## Diversity and gender-sensitive language

- The task of all Bavarian universities is to promote diversity and gender equality and to counteract discrimination (cf. Art. 2 Abs. 5 and Art. 25 Abs. 2 BayHIG). The prohibition of discrimination based on gender is enshrined in the Basic Law (Art. 3 Abs. 3 Satz 1 GG), and the university, in its capacity as an employer, is obligated to protect against discrimination.
- The Bavarian State Government has decided, according to the cabinet report on Tuesday, March 19, 2024, to amend the General Administrative Regulation for the authorities of the Free State of Bavaria (AGO). It states that the use of gender-neutral language (Gender Gap, Gender Star, colon, or mediopoint) in official correspondence is expressly prohibited.
