## Pages that require an update for the transition

To mark pages that require changes, the `transition_status` and `transition_comment` fields can be added to the yaml header as follows:

```markdown
---
title: "Resources"
transition_status: "toupdate"
transition_comment: "Update keys, lab access, printing/scanning, design, archive"
---

contents ....

```

Once the transition is implemented, the `transition_status` can be changed to `updated`.

---
listing:
  title: "Pages to change"
  contents: ../**
  type: table
  sort: "path"
  fields: [path, title, transition_comment]
  include:
    transition_status: "toupdate"
  page-size: 200
