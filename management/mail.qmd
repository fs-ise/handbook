This section is marked as "toupdate": Update procedures, add letter template

TODO: integrate the Excel lists in a repository (private (e.g., Jour-Fixe agenda) or public?) - see mail-hub idea
:::

This section summarizes how the lab's official mail channels are managed.

## Incoming

- E-Mail is handled by the Team Assistant (e-mail: see team website).
- Physical mail is retrieved from the mailroom on a regular basis (Postfach Nr.: 44).
- Incoming physical mail is tracked in [Ausgangspost _Eingangspost.xlsx]({{< var nextcloud.mail_tracker >}}){target=_blank}.

- Email: "Terminplanung" (UnivIS): primarily track the deadline for entering courses in FlexNow

## Processing

- **Physical mail** that needs to be archived in paper is added to [Archive]({{< var nextcloud.archive >}}){target=_blank}:


  - Only mandatory documents are archived in paper form
  - They receive a unique ID `XXXXXX` (Paginierstempel)
  - Scanned and added to the [Archive]({{< var nextcloud.archive >}})

  ![Paginierstempel example](/assets/images/Screenshot_Stamp.jpg)

- GW applies OCR (Nextcloud notifications are activated)

- Physical mail (documents) related to **theses**:

  - For signed topic confirmations, thesis supervisors update the [overview](https://github.com/fs-ise/theses-confidential/tree/main/theses){target=_blank}. Check and remind (if necessary): thesis advisors should have moved the documents related to the thesis to [35 theses]({{< var nextcloud.theses >}}){target=_blank}.
  - Submissions, an issue must be created in the [theses-confidential](https://github.com/fs-ise/theses-confidential/issues){target=_blank}, uploading the digital version of the thesis. The paper version is [archived](/management/archive.html) immediately.
  - Reviews are scanned, the PDF is added to 14.04, and the paper version is sent to the examination office (no cover letter, Hauspost: Ref II/3).

## Outgoing

**TODO: add letter template here**

- Outgoing physical mail is tracked in [Ausgangspost _Eingangspost.xlsx]({{< var nextcloud.mail_tracker >}}){target=_blank}.

- Outgoing physical mail is scanned and archived in the relevant project directories.
- Stamps are available at the Team Assistant's office.
