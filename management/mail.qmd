This section summarizes how the lab's official mail channels are managed.

## Incoming

- E-Mail is handled by the Team Assistant (e-mail: see team website).
- Physical mail is retrieved from the mailroom on a regular basis (Postfach Nr.: 44).
- Incoming physical mail is tracked in [Ausgangspost _Eingangspost.xlsx](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/10-lab/10_processes/51_mail&fileid=8856){target=_blank}.

- GW applies OCR (Nextcloud notifications are activated)
    
- Physical mail (documents) related to **theses**:

  - For signed topic confirmations, thesis supervisors update the [overview](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/theses-confidential/tree/main/theses){target=_blank}. Check and remind (if necessary): thesis advisors should have moved the documents related to the thesis to [35 theses](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-30-teaching/35_theses&fileid=124){target=_blank}.
  - Submissions, an issue must be created in the [theses-confidential](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/theses-confidential/issues){target=_blank}, uploading the digital version of the thesis. The paper version is [archived](/management/archive.html) immediately.
  - Reviews are scanned, the PDF is added to 14.04, and the paper version is sent to the examination office (no cover letter, Hauspost: Ref II/3).
