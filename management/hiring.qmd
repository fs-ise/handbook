## Processes

When sending documents to HR, clearly indicate who should receive the confirmation documents and contracts.

- [PhD students](10.31.contracts_phd.html) (wissenschaftliches Personal)
- [Student assistants](10.31.contracts_sa.html)
- [Staff](10.31.contracts_staff.html)

## Subsequent steps
