Welcome to the chapter on IT systems.
<!-- 
This guide is intended to offer you with a useful overview on the many IT technologies and tools that support the administrative processes and lead you to the right places to learn more about them.
This manual will serve as resource for navigating the digital environment, from learning platforms to communication tools, data analysis software to writing tools.
-->
We prefer open-source tools and open-data formats:

- **[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){target=_blank}**, a markup language, which allows us to creating formatted documents, papers, websites, presentations using plain text (formatting such as headings, lists, bold, italics, and links). It is platform-independent, integrates well with git, and can easily be converted to other formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, DOCX) using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/){target=_blank}. Citations can be included via the [CSL](https://citationstyles.org/){target=_blank} project.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/){target=_blank}**, a distributed version control system to collaborate on software development projects, data analyses, paper writing, and teaching materials. It allows users to work on the same file, to track changes, to merge different versions or branches, and revert to any previous state.

The structure of the handbook is used to to organize files on nextcloud. Projects are structured as [follows](LINK).
