## How to suggest changes

1. Navigate to the page you would like to change
2. Click on "Help improve this page", sign in, and the "Edit this file" button
3. Add your changes in [GitHub markdown](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax){target=_blank}
4. Commit the changes to a new branch
5. Assign the maintainer to review and merge your changes

## Principles

- **Confidential data**, such as grades and student identities, must not be stored in the handbook. Instead, add a link to the confidential data store (see [example](theses.html){target=_blank})
- **Checklists** should be simple, structured, and actionable
- Add **links to other parts of the handbook or external resources** to avoid replicating content.
- **Headings**: Use sentence case (not Title Case) for all headings and subheadings.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document, particularly for lists, tables, and citations.


- **Formatting resources** are available in the [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/){target=_blank}
