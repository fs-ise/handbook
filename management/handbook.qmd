This handbook is designed to support collaboration and effective learning in our lab.
It reduces friction and helps us focus on the work that matters most. Key advantages include:

- **Reduced search and communication overhead**: Information becomes easily discoverable instead of relying on individual memory or repeated explanations.  
- **Faster onboarding**: Students, assistants, and new collaborators can quickly understand expectations, tools, and workflows.  
- **Standardization and clarity**: Consistent processes and formatting support a reliable, high-quality way of working.  
- **Support for stigmergic collaboration**: Like in open-source projects, visible contributions encourage further improvements and self-organizing progress over time.  
- **Sustainable knowledge retention**: Guidance remains accessible even when responsibilities shift or team members move on.  
- **Shared learning across labs**: We adopt proven practices from others and offer our own experiences openly, strengthening the broader community.  

> “Civilization advances by increasing the number of things we can do without thinking about them.” — Alfred North Whitehead  

By documenting what works, we make everyday tasks simpler and leave more room for creativity, collaboration, and discovery.

::: {.callout-note title="Single source of truth"collapse="true"}
For anything that must be correct and consistent over time (e.g., **course offerings**, **teaching dates**, **presentations**, **research projects**, **paper lists**, **lab processes**), the handbook should be the **single source of truth**.

**Rule of thumb:** if a date, decision, or list appears in multiple places, we should consolidate it here (or have one canonical source and link to it from here).
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Emergence"collapse="true"}
Our handbook follows an **emergent** logic: we improve it continuously through small contributions, iteration, and learning-by-doing.

A good reference point is *The Turing Way*’s framing of [emergent strategy and living guidance](https://book.the-turing-way.org/foreword/emergent-strategy/){target=_blank}.

::: {.callout-note title="Linking" collapse="true"}
Linking is a core practice, not an afterthought.
This handbook is most useful when it works like a **map**:

- Link to **other handbook pages** instead of duplicating content.
- Link to the **systems where the work happens** (e.g., GitHub repos, issue trackers, course pages, calendars, templates).

We also maintain **automated link checks** and quality controls (linters/statistics) to reduce link rot and make sure references remain usable.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Reports and automation" collapse="true"}
We keep key parts of the handbook **up-to-date automatically** using GitHub Actions workflows and Python scripts.

- Workflows: https://github.com/fs-ise/handbook/tree/main/.github/workflows
- Scripts: https://github.com/fs-ise/handbook/tree/main/src

These jobs retrieve externaal data to regenerate report artifacts (tables, pages, figures) and commit updates back to the repository.

## How to suggest changes

1. Navigate to the page you would like to change.
2. Click on "Edit this page," sign in, and then click the "Edit this file" button.
3. Add your changes in [GitHub markdown](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax){target=_blank}.
4. Commit the changes to a new branch.
5. Assign the maintainer to review and merge your changes.

Note on deployment: The handbook is hosted on GitHub Pages. The deployment may take a few minutes to complete. You can check the status [here](https://github.com/fs-ise/handbook/actions){target=_blank}.

## Principles

- **Confidential data**: Confidential data, such as grades and student identities, must not be stored in the handbook. Instead, add a link to the confidential data store (see [example](/teaching/theses.html){target=_blank}).
- **Checklists**: Checklists should be simple, structured, and actionable.
- **Add links**: Add links to other parts of the handbook or external resources to avoid replicating content.
- **Headings**: Use sentence case (not title case) for all headings and subheadings.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document, particularly for lists, tables, and citations.
- **Formatting resources**: Formatting resources are available in the [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/){target=_blank}.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Example page

::: {.callout-important}
Each sentence should be on a new line (to ensure that the git diff is readable). To create a paragraph, add an empty line. This makes the history more readable and merging easier (see [semantic line breaks](https://sembr.org/){target=_blank}).
