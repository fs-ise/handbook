title: "P&R sessions"
---

This guide helps plan and run effective *review and planning sessions*, aka. employee development conversations. It offers suggested focus areas and example questions to support:

1. Review of past progress and current responsibilities,  
2. Making ambitious plans, ensuring the necessary resources, support, and training are in place.

The sessions are designed as conversations, aiming for reflection and mutual understanding while also documenting specific outcomes and agreements. Use the prompts selectively—there is no requirement to cover every question.
