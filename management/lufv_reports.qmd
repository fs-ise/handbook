→ "Erhebungsbogen" is completed only once per chair.

## Responsibility

- Professor

## Process

- Notification is sent out by the Dean's office (mid-July / mid-January)
- The form is available online ([Erklärung zur Erfüllung der Lehrverpflichtung](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/abt-personal/formulare-infos-und-merkblaetter/){target=_blank} / Lehrdeputat)
- Required to teach 7 SWS (in the first three years: 5 SWS).
- When reporting more (or less), a reason must be provided (e.g., "Sicherstellung des Lehrangebots").

Theses

- Check for [theses completed this semester](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/theses-confidential){target=_blank}.
- Check [prior reports](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/files/62?dir=/10-lab/19_archive){target=_blank} to **avoid reporting the same thesis twice**.
- Theses can be reported in the semester of admission or grading.
- If the LUFV deadline has already passed, a thesis can also be reported in the following semester.
- Theses that have required considerable effort for supervision but were not completed may also be reported.
- SWS: 0.15 for Bachelor's theses, and 0.45 for Master's theses (Bachelorarbeit / Diplom- bzw. Masterarbeit in Ingenieurswissenschaften).
- A maximum of 2 SWS for theses can be reported per semester.

Projects

- Declared as a "Seminar" (factor: 1) - without splitting groups
- Note: new categories will become available soon, including "projects".

Submission

- Print, sign, and add a copy to the [19 archive](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/files/62?dir=/10-lab/19_archive){target=_blank}.
