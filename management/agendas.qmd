To facilitate planning and collaboration, we work with agenda repositories.
An agenda repository is a shared GitHub repository with a README.md file to keep track of meeting notes, TODOs, and items to discuss.
It serves as a single location to track information that can be linked and edited by all participants.

## Checklist for agendas

Use the following checklist to keep your agenda repository a practical, living resource for planning, coordination, and reflection.

::: {.callout-note title="Checklist"}

## 1. Make the agenda your own

- [ ] Keep in mind: the agenda will remain a private repository, shared between you and your supervisor.  
- [ ] Treat the agenda as a shared but informal working document (no perfection needed).  
- [ ] Adapt the structure to your personal workflow.  
- [ ] Use it regularly as your primary planning resource.  

---

## 2. Update the agenda regularly

- [ ] Define and revisit shared goals ([objectives and key results (OKR)](TODO)) together.  
- [ ] Maintain a list of major ongoing projects.  
- [ ] Keep a running “Items to Discuss” section.  
- [ ] Maintain a weekly task list:  
  - [ ] Check off completed items.  
  - [ ] Copy unfinished items to the next week.  
- [ ] Share a link to meeting notes before the meeting.
- [ ] Add meeting notes directly after each meeting.  

---

## 3. Create a clear overview

- [ ] Keep orientation easy: structure before detail.  
- [ ] Use folders and multiple documents where helpful.  
- [ ] Add internal links between sections.  
- [ ] Link to relevant external resources (repos, docs, papers, courses).  
- [ ] Ensure the agenda can be understood quickly by all participants.  

---

## 4. Maintain a timeline and planning view

- [ ] Create Mermaid timelines (Gantt charts).  
- [ ] Track contracts and important deadlines.  
- [ ] Keep an overview of workload / hours.  
- [ ] Plan development goals (topics, methods, skills).  
- [ ] Map current and future projects over time.  

---

## 5. Anticipate and track key periods

- [ ] Note upcoming vacations.  
- [ ] Mark exam phases or teaching peaks.  
- [ ] Maintain “waiting-for” items (e.g., reviews, decisions, responses).  
- [ ] Maintain “upcoming” items (projects, papers, milestones).  

---

## 6. Document interests and ideas

- [ ] Keep a section for research and teaching interests.  
- [ ] Collect ideas for new projects.  
- [ ] Use this as input for strategic discussions about next steps.  

---

## 7. Document and celebrate success

- [ ] Record accepted/published papers.  
- [ ] Add positive student feedback.
