## Precondition

Certificates are created in two cases:

1. Students cannot register for an exam via FlexNow, the examination office was asked to activate the registration, and the examination committee has agreed (see [1](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/ism/studium/anmeldung-scheinklausur/){target=_blank})
2. The course has not yet been created in FlexNow

## Process

- The template and scripts for creating certificates is available [here](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/src/scheine){target=_blank}.
- Certificates must be printed, signed and stamped.
- Certificates are stored in [14.05](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/10-lab/14_grades/05_scheine&fileid=74){target=_blank}.
- Students can retrieve certificates at the Team Assistant's office.
