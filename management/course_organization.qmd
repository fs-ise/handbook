TODO : describe the process and system of booking lecture rooms.

## Creating new modules/courses

See [teaching/new](../teaching/new.html)

## Scheduling of courses

The scheduling department (individuals responsible for specific degree programs) contacts me (with preferences gathered via Google Forms). I then receive a proposed schedule (I must manually check and resolve conflicts between programs; if necessary, clarify with the scheduling department or speak directly with colleagues). Ensure that module coordinators list me as the instructor (otherwise invitations will be sent to the wrong person).

## Coordination

Planned: Coordination meetings for overlapping course materials.

## Room bookings UnivIS

::: callout-important
First, the dean's office books the central courses, then the secretariats are _allowed_ to book their decentralized courses
:::

July:
- Email from the dean's office with the occupancy plan for the central courses (?)

- Pay attention to overlaps within the chair
- After booking a room, you must inform Alex **immediately**
