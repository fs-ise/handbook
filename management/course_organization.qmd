## Scheduling of courses

The scheduling department (individuals responsible for specific degree programs) contacts me (with preferences gathered via Google Forms). I then receive a proposed schedule (I must manually check and resolve conflicts between programs; if necessary, clarify with the scheduling department or speak directly with colleagues). Ensure that module coordinators list me as the instructor (otherwise invitations will be sent to the wrong person).

## Coordination

Planned: Coordination meetings for overlapping course materials.
