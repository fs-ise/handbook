Welcome to the vacation section for the digital-work lab! This guide streamlines the administrative process for requesting and managing vacation time. Enjoy your time off and return refreshed 🌴 ✈️ 🏖️

## 1. Take vacation

- To take vacation, coordinate your responsibilities (such as teaching and project work), decide when to take vacation, and *inform* Gerit in advance via e-mail (ideally, at least 2 weeks in advance)
- If there are any additional scheduling constraints, Gerit will respond and ask for a meeting to discuss possible adjustments
- If you do not receive a response within **3 days**, the request is approved (following the principle of "[lazy consensus](https://openoffice.apache.org/docs/governance/lazyConsensus.html){target=_blank}").
- Add your vacation to the agenda repository and/or internal shared calendar (**TODO**). If students need to know about your availability, you may add your vacation to the [Calendar](index.html).

**E-Mail template:**

```markdown
Subject: Vacation Notice

Hi Gerit,

I will be on vacation on the following dates:

Start: [Date]
End:   [Date]

I have coordinated my responsibilities and ensured that teaching, project work, and
other duties are covered during my absence.

If there are any scheduling issues, please let me know. If I don’t hear back within
three days, I will assume that my vacation request is approved, as outlined in our
guidelines.

Cheers,
[Your Name]
```


**Scientific Staff**

Fill out the official vacation request form, available on the HR page of Uni Bamberg (Urlaubsantrag für wissenschaftliche Beschäftigte) **[Link](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/abt-personal/formulare-infos-und-merkblaetter/){target=_blank}** and send it to your supervisor or just send an informal e-mail with the requested vacation date.

**Non-scientific Staff**

Send your vacation request via **[BayZeit](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/intranet/arbeitsplatz/zeiterfassung/){target=_blank}**. Specific instructions can be found in the manual, which is available under the same link.

**Student Assistants**

Send an informal e-mail to your supervisor with the requested vacation date. To calculate your vacation days you can use this **[form](https://zuvportal.uni-bamberg.de/Hilfskraftvertraege/urlaubsanspruch_hk_ber.jspx){target=_blank}**.

::: callout-note
**Calculation**

With flexible working hours, which are the norm, the vacation entitlement is calculated as follows: <br>
→ ((monthly hours / 4.348 ) / 5) x 1.66 x months; the result must be rounded commercially!

:::

## 2. Documentation - Vacation Balances Tracking:

- The remaining vacation days for **non-scientific staff** are stated in **[BayZeit](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/intranet/arbeitsplatz/zeiterfassung/){target=_blank}** (Urlaubsbogen für aktuelles Jahr)
- **Student assistants** are requested to track their current balance of vacation days/hours on their monthly timesheet.

## 3. Communication - Notification to Colleagues:

- **Notify your immediate colleagues personally and state vacation/absence days in your outlook calendar.**
- **Inform your students (if applicable):** If you're a teacher, notify your students about your absence. Depending on their age and the nature of your classes, you can either inform them verbally or send a written communication. Include the dates of your vacation and any instructions or assignments they need to complete in your absence.
- **Set up an out-of-office message:** Configure an out-of-office email auto-responder, clearly stating the dates of your vacation and providing an alternative point of contact for urgent matters.

## 4. Handover Procedures

- **Communication and briefing:** Prior to the researcher's holiday, they should schedule a meeting with the team members to discuss the ongoing projects, tasks, and any pending deadlines. They should communicate any critical information, potential challenges, and specific instructions for handling various scenarios.
- **Documenting project details:** The researcher should ensure that all project-related information is documented and organized in a central location. The team members should have access to this documentation. Additionally, the researcher should clearly outline the responsibilities and roles of each team member during the handover period.

## 5. Exceptions and Special Circumstances

**Emergency Situations**

- During emergency situations when an important team member is on vacation, it is crucial to have a plan in place. The first step is to identify a designated **backup or point of contact** who can assume the responsibilities and decision-making authority of the absent team member.
- This backup should be well-informed about the ongoing projects, possess the necessary expertise, and be able to make critical decisions in the absence of the vacationing team member.

**Changes in Vacation Plans**

- When changes need to be made to the vacation plan, **open and transparent communication is the key**.
The team member should promptly notify their supervisor about the change, providing a clear explanation and any necessary documentation.

## 6. FAQs and Additional Resources

**How far in advance should vacation requests be submitted?**

* Vacation requests should be submitted at least two weeks in advance, to allow for proper planning and coordination.

**What is the policy for carrying over unused vacation days to the next year?**

* It is recommended to take all vacation days in the same year. You may be required to take your vacations before a certain date in the following year (other regulations may apply).
