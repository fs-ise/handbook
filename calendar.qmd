Our shared public calendar has dates for upcoming events in the lab.
It contains mostly public events that are of interest to the team and students.

<div id="ec"></div>

To subscribe directly, you can export the .ics file, then add the calendar to Outlook or Thunderbird.

```sh

```

To add or modify events, edit the `events.yaml` file [here]({{< meta handbook.url >}}/edit/main/data/events.yaml){target=_blank}.
