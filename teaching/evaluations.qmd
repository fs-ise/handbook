::: callout-note
This section is marked as "toupdate": update completely
:::

## Purpose

Evaluate teaching activities **at the end of each semester**.

::: callout-note
**Trigger**
Evaluations can be ordered by **early December / early July**. We receive an e-mail reminder.
:::

## Process

- Evaluations can be ordered via EvaSys, which requires a **minimum of 5 students** to complete the evaluation. Otherwise, anonymity is not given, and results will not be made available.
- For small courses, it is possible to use other tools or modes of evaluation.
- It is possible and recommended that the survey be adapted (shortened).
- Evaluation results and potential improvements should be discussed with students (last week of teaching).
- Students should be reminded in the session and via VC.
- Add to the list of prior reports below.
- The evaluation results are stored in 19.XXXXXX (Nextcloud) and published in the handbook: Upload PDFs in [assets/evaluations](https://github.com/fs-ise/handbook/tree/main/assets/evaluations){target=_blank} and link them in the [course files](https://github.com/fs-ise/handbook/tree/main/_courses){target=_blank}.
- Evaluation results should be analyzed to improve teaching activities. Improvements are documented in the [Improvements](/teaching/improvements.html) section.
- Evaluation results are shared (e.g., via e-mail or link in VC) and discussed with students.

Note: We are allowed to publish evaluation reports (no personal information, no hand-written responses that could identify individuals).
