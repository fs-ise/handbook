On this page, we collect resources for student counselling.

We are committed to ensuring a safe, diverse, and supportive university environment by being prepared to assist students in navigating challenges they may face.
Our instructors, teaching assistants and staff are sensitized to the various resources available, allowing us to respond promptly and effectively to student needs.
Whether it's providing guidance on study organization, addressing mental health concerns, or offering support in cases of discrimination or harassment, we are dedicated to helping students access the help they need.
Our goal is to ensure that every student feels supported and empowered throughout their academic journey.
