title: "Quarto"

## TODO

- Layout: template, font, logo (see /home/gerit/ownCloud/inbox/quarto/presentation-example-big_data_analytics)
- Interaction (seminar plugin + feedback flow)
- Ask students how they learn (PDF, ...) whether they use a knowledge management system (which one), ...


## Principles

- Design contents in such a way that students can learn them (after the session, pdf, making comments)
- Add dynamic illustrations only as an extra (link them in the offline version)

## Layout

typography defaults:

```css
  --font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif;
```

Adding headings to the navigation

```qmd
## Heading {data-menu-title="I. Overview"}

### Will not be in the navigation

```

## PDF output for students based on an `all-slides.qmd` (with `make pdf`)

```qmd
---
title: "BDA Analytics (LECTURE)"
format: revealjs
---

# BDA Analytics  (LECTURE)

Hand-made toc

\newpage

## Lecture 1

\{\{< include lecture_1.qmd >\}\}

\newpage

## Lecture 2

\{\{< include lecture_2.qmd >\}\}

```

## Adding extensions

```bash
docker compose run --rm quarto quarto add gadenbuie/countdown/quarto
docker compose run --rm quarto quarto add martinomagnifico/quarto-simplemenu
```


## Publishing to github pages

https://www.jtrive.com/posts/creating-gh-pages-blog-with-quarto/creating-gh-pages-blog-with-quarto.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com
for `quarto publish gh-pages` : install quarto locally (otherwise, the ssh and git setup in the docker container requires detailed configuration)
