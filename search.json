They help team members acquire new skills, expand their knowledge, and stay updated with the latest advancements in their respective fields.\nYou can complete courses and gain further qualifications online at the VHS website.\nIdentify Individual Needs: Start by conducting a skills assessment to identify the training needs of each team member. This can be done through one-on-one discussions, self-assessment forms, or performance evaluations. Encourage team members to express their interests and areas where they want to develop their expertise.\nCreate a Training Plan: Based on the identified needs, develop a training plan that outlines the specific training programs or activities for each team member. Consider a mix of internal and external training options such as workshops, conferences, online courses, mentoring, and on-the-job training.\nEncourage Self-Learning: In addition to formal training programs, promote a culture of self-learning within the team. Encourage team members to explore relevant resources like online tutorials, books, research papers, and industry blogs. Provide access to online learning platforms or subscription services that offer a wide range of educational content.\nInternal Knowledge Sharing: Organize regular knowledge-sharing sessions where team members can present and discuss their ongoing projects, research findings, or new tools and techniques they have learned. Encourage collaboration and peer learning within the team.\nExternal Networking: Encourage team members to attend conferences, workshops, and seminars relevant to their research interests. Networking with experts in the field and participating in discussions and panels can provide valuable learning and collaboration opportunities.\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nFeedback and Support: We regularly check in with team members to assess their progress and provide support. We share learning experiences, challenges faced, and areas where we need further assistance. We offer guidance and mentorship to help all team members overcome obstacles and make the most of their development opportunities.",

Bitte senden Sie ab 01.04.2024 Rechnungen über Publikationskosten (= Kosten im Zusammenhang mit der Veröffentlichung wissenschaftlicher Dokumente) direkt an die Universitätsbibliothek (UB/F21, rechnungswesen.ub@uni-bamberg.de ). Bitte geben Sie bei der Rechnung wie bisher die Kostenstelle an und ob die Rechnung aus dem regulären Lehrstuhletat oder aus einem spezifischen Drittmittelkonto bezahlt werden soll. Die Universitätsbibliothek wird die Rechnung dann bearbeiten.\nDie Rechnungen werden ab 01.04.24 direkt von der Bibliothek gebucht und auch dort abgelegt. Es ist zwingend darauf zu achten, dass jede Rechnung mit „sachlich und rechnerisch richtig“ unterzeichnet ist.\n“Aus dem Open-Access-Fonds kann hier weiterhin eine Unterstützung mit maximal 2.000 Euro pro Artikel erfolgen. Jedoch kann diese Finanzierung auf Empfehlung des Beirats der Universitätsbibliothek nun auch anteilig erfolgen, d.h. die Publikationsgebühr darf über diesem Betrag liegen. Für den darüber hinausgehenden Anteil müssen die Autorinnen und Autoren eine andere Finanzierung angeben. Unverändert bleibt, dass aus dem Open-Access-Fonds nur Beiträge gefördert werden, die in “echten“ Open-Access-Zeitschriften erscheinen, deren Beiträge sämtlich unmittelbar mit Erscheinen open access zugänglich sind. Eine Doppelfinanzierung von Zeitschriften durch Publikationsgebühren und Abo-Gebühren möchten wir nicht unterstützen.”\nOpen-Access Fonds",

    "text": "The digitalization of knowledge work is reshaping how tasks are performed across various industries, with significant implications for individual workers and organizations. This transformation is driven by the adoption of digital work practices, distributed organizing models, powerful AI capabilities, and advancements in knowledge synthesis. These shifts are creating new opportunities and challenges for knowledge workers, as traditional practices are reconfigured by emerging technologies.\nOur focus is on understanding these shifts at the intersection of digital work, distributed organizing, and knowledge synthesis, identifying effective practices, and designing tools to meet the evolving demands of knowledge workers.\nOur work builds on literature review methods, design science research, and empirical research. We work on projects in collaboration with researchers from institutions like HEC Montréal, Sydney University, the University of Virginia, Bamberg University, and Dortmund University. These joint efforts enable us to combine expertise across disciplines and leverage synergies between different research streams, allowing us to tackle both practical applications and foundational questions. This integrated approach helps us address key challenges in digital knowledge work while driving advancements that benefit both academic research and industry practices.\n\n\nSummary This research stream explores the evolving role of individual knowledge workers, such as physicians, data scientists, developers, and innovative thinkers, whose work is characterized by agility, innovation, and emergent practices driven by experience and expertise rather than formalized procedures. It focuses on how digital technologies, particularly AI, are reconfiguring these work practices. Key areas of inquiry include the adoption of AI in professional settings, the interaction between AI and evidence-based practices, and how expert knowledge can be leveraged to adapt and improve enterprise systems. At the core, the goal of this research stream is to understand how knowledge work practices are reconfigured by digital technology and to provide actionable insights for leaders in knowledge-intensive fields, enabling them to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the digitalization of work, optimize the integration of new technologies, and enhance the effectiveness of digital work environments.\nExemplary research questions\n\nAdoption of AI What are the AI profiles of prospective physicians associated with a strong intention to use AIHT in their future medical practice?\nInteraction of AI with traditional evidence-based practices Do new AI capabilities reduce or reinforce evidence-based practices?\nLeveraging expertise to adapt enterprise systems How can the expertise of clinical experts be used to resolve misfits in enterprise systems?\n\nSelected publications\n\n\nWagner, G., Raymond, L., and Paré, G.

These include distributed (Git-based) knowledge work, open-source communities, online labor markets, and open strategy initiatives such as open employee handbooks in all-remote organizations. These models are widely used in large tech companies, knowledge-intensive industries, and academia. The primary goal is to understand how distributed work practices can be organized effectively and how to manage these work arrangements for maximum productivity. This includes informing stakeholders about best practices for integrating these models with existing organizational frameworks.\nExemplary research questions\n\nProcesses of knowledge-intensive crowd work How can online marketplaces for knowledge-intensive service work be distinguished? How can the micro-and macro-level processes be organized?\nEffective sourcing of knowledge work in online labor markets What explains the successful sourcing of knowledge work from online labor markets at the level of individual workers and projects?\n\nSelected publications\n\n\nWagner, G., Prester, J., and Paré, G.

While the volume of available knowledge continues to increase, methods for synthesizing this research—particularly in the context of open and reproducible literature reviews—are falling behind. Key areas needing improvement include search query construction, validation, knowledge record matching, emergent concept analyses, and enhancing transparency and validation through AI and generative AI (GenAI) tools. These challenges are crucial across many fields, particularly for professions like medicine, where synthesizing the best available evidence is essential. At the core, the goal of this research stream is to design tools that make knowledge synthesis processes more efficient, transparent, and reliable, benefiting practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and students who navigate both academic and industry perspectives.\nExemplary research questions\n\nAI/LLM-supported literature reviews How can AI and LLM capabilities support the individual steps of the literature review process?\nUnderstanding quality and impact of review papers What makes a literature review successful in terms of scientific impact?\nDesign of open and reproducible research synthesis platforms How can tools make literature reviews and knowledge synthesis more efficient, transparent, and reliable?\n\nSelected publications\n\n\nWagner, G.

These include distributed (Git-based) knowledge work, open-source communities, online labor markets, and open strategy initiatives such as open employee handbooks in all-remote organizations. These models are widely used in large tech companies, knowledge-intensive industries, and academia. The primary goal is to understand how distributed work practices can be organized effectively and how to manage these work arrangements for maximum productivity. This includes informing stakeholders about best practices for integrating these models with existing organizational frameworks.\nExemplary research questions\n\nProcesses of knowledge-intensive crowd work How can online marketplaces for knowledge-intensive service work be distinguished? How can the micro-and macro-level processes be organized?\nEffective sourcing of knowledge work in online labor markets What explains the successful sourcing of knowledge work from online labor markets at the level of individual workers and projects?\n\nSelected publications\n\n\nWagner, G., Prester, J., and Paré, G.

While the volume of available knowledge continues to increase, methods for synthesizing this research—particularly in the context of open and reproducible literature reviews—are falling behind. Key areas needing improvement include search query construction, validation, knowledge record matching, emergent concept analyses, and enhancing transparency and validation through AI and generative AI (GenAI) tools. These challenges are crucial across many fields, particularly for professions like medicine, where synthesizing the best available evidence is essential. At the core, the goal of this research stream is to design tools that make knowledge synthesis processes more efficient, transparent, and reliable, benefiting practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and students who navigate both academic and industry perspectives.\nExemplary research questions\n\nAI/LLM-supported literature reviews How can AI and LLM capabilities support the individual steps of the literature review process?\nUnderstanding quality and impact of review papers What makes a literature review successful in terms of scientific impact?\nDesign of open and reproducible research synthesis platforms How can tools make literature reviews and knowledge synthesis more efficient, transparent, and reliable?\n\nSelected publications\n\n\nWagner, G.

    "text": "Ideational impact refers to the uptake of a paper’s ideas and concepts by subsequent research. It is defined in stark contrast to total citation impact, a measure predominantly used in research evaluation that assumes that all citations are equal. Understanding ideational impact is critical for evaluating research impact and understanding how scientific disciplines build a cumulative tradition. Research has only recently developed automated citation classification techniques to distinguish between different types of citations and generally does not emphasize the conceptual content of the citations and its ideational impact. To address this problem, we develop Deep Content-enriched Ideational Impact Classification (Deep-CENIC) as the first automated approach for ideational impact classification to support researchers’ literature search practices. We evaluate Deep-CENIC on 1256 papers citing 24 information systems review articles from the IT business value domain. We show that Deep-CENIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background The practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has become pivotal in enhancing medical care and patient outcomes. With the diffusion of innovation in healthcare organizations, EBM can be expected to depend on medical professionals’ competences with digital health (dHealth) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Objective We aim to investigate the effect of dHealth competences and perceptions of AI on the adoption of EBM among prospective physicians. By focusing on dHealth and AI technologies, the study seeks to inform the redesign of medical curricula to better prepare students for the demands of evidence-based medical practice. Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered online to students at the University of Montreal’s medical school, which has approximately 1,400 enrolled students. The survey included questions on students’ dHealth competences, perceptions of AI, and their practice of EBM. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we analyzed data from 177 respondents to test our research model. Results Our analysis indicates that medical students possess foundational knowledge competences of dHealth technologies and perceive AI to play an important role in the future of medicine. Yet, their experiential competences with dHealth technologies are limited. Our findings reveal that experiential dHealth competences are significantly related to the practice of EBM (β = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001), as well as students’ perceptions of the role of AI in the future of medicine (β = 0.39, p &lt; 0.001), which, in turn, also affect EBM (β = 0.19, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The study underscores the necessity of enhancing students’ competences related to dHealth and considering their perceptions of the role of AI in the medical profession. In particular, the low levels of experiential dHealth competences highlight a promising starting point for training future physicians while simultaneously strengthening their practice of EBM. Accordingly, we suggest revising medical curricula to focus on providing students with practical experiences with dHealth and AI technologies.\n\n\n  Article / DOI link    Open access PDF \n\n\n\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A growing amount of research is dedicated to digital markets for knowledge work services and contracting decisions as one of their most critical bottlenecks. Large-scale studies with average samples exceeding 144,000 observations have considered over 70 variables explaining contracting decisions. Our review aims to facilitate the convergence towards commonly agreed categories of variables and overarching models of contracting decisions in this context. To mitigate the risk of propagating deflated p-values associated with large sample studies, we propose a robust version of vote-counting techniques. The principal findings of our research suggest that only a few variables related to the client-worker relationship, the bid and individual worker characteristics have a practically significant effect on worker selection, and that auction success is primarily affected by project value and client experience.

Information systems (IS) students aspiring to fill software engineering, management, or research positions would therefore benefit from familiarity with Git. However, teaching Git effectively can be challenging, as students in IS and other disciplines report themselves overwhelmed by the plethora of Git’s detailed commands and options, including those involved in local setup and secure shell (SSH) connections.

    "text": "Background Centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) is underused due to low referral rates, accessibility barriers, and socioeconomic constraints. mHealth technologies have the potential to address some of these challenges through remote delivery of home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR). This study aims to assess the effects of mHealth HBCR interventions compared with usual care and CBCR in patients with heart disease. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of mHealth HBCR interventions. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched from inception to March 31, 2023, with no restrictions on language or publication type. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of adult patients (age ≥18 years) with heart disease, comparing mHealth interventions with usual care or CBCR. The primary outcome of interest was aerobic exercise capacity, assessed with VO2 peak or 6-min walk test (6MWT). Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024544087. Findings Our search yielded 9164 references, of which 135 were retained for full-text review. 13 randomised controlled trials met eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review, involving 1508 adults with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or heart failure, or who had undergone revascularisation. Intervention duration ranged from 6 weeks to 24 weeks. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that, compared with usual care, mHealth HBCR significantly improved 6MWT (mean difference 24·74, 95% CI 9·88–39·60; 532 patients) and VO2 peak (1·77, 1·19–2·35; 359 patients). No significant differences were found between mHealth HBCR and CBCR. Quality of evidence ranged from low to very low across outcomes due to risk of bias and imprecision (small sample size). Interpretation mHealth HBCR could improve access and health outcomes in patients who are unable to attend CBCR. Further research is needed to build a robust evidence base on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mHealth HBCR, particularly in comparison with CBCR, to inform clinical practice and policy.\n\n\n  Article / DOI link    Open access PDF \n\n\n\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

It is constructed with a focus on four requirements: (1) Zero false positives: The primary objective is to prevent incorrectly merging distinct entries. This focus on zero false positives is crucial to ensure trustworthiness and prevent biased conclusions in the analysis. (2) Reproducibility: BibDedupe implements fixed rules to produce consistent results, in line with the scientific standard of reproducibility. (3) Efficiency: The library is also tuned for low false-negative rates and rapid processing, to ensure scalability of the duplicate identification process. (4) Continuous evaluation and improvement: It is continuously evaluated on over 160,000 records from 10 datasets to ensure its effectiveness, especially in follow-up refinements. Unlike general-purpose deduplication tools, BibDedupe is specifically designed for the unique requirements of bibliographic data in meta-analysis and research synthesis. In this context, BibDedupe aims to provide a Python library that improves the effectiveness and efficiency of duplicate identification, potentially benefitting review papers across scientific disciplines.\n\n\n  Article / DOI link    Open access PDF \n\n\n\n\nCode / source: https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/bib-dedupe\n\n\n\n\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

Although many papers cite RAs, it is rarely transparent to which degree citation impact represents perfunctory citations as opposed to a deeper engagement with a RA’s knowledge contributions. This distinction between perfunctory and ideational impact has largely been neglected in the literature arguably because of the manual effort required for qualitative analysis. Against this background, our study aims at developing automated classifiers of ideational impact of IS RAs. We propose a machine learning model based on natural language processing to evaluate the feasibility of automated analyses. The evaluation results provide evidence for an effective and scalable classification approach that presents a reliable and reproducible solution to the ideational impact classification problem. We discuss implications for improving the capabilities of understanding how IS scholars build on their field’s body of knowledge.}\n}"

It is recommended to configure save actions to store titles as sentence case, normalize names of persons for author fields, and to normalize page numbers. Changes in the bib-file should be checked before committing and adding {} to protect cases when necessary (e.g., {J}ab{R}ef).\nFormatting the bibliography (*.bib file)\n\nTitle field: use sentence case (e.g., “On the origin of species”, not “On the Origin of Species”). CSL styles that require title case will use an automatic title-case conversion (1).\nJournal field: use long version (e.g., “Journal of Information Technology”, not “JIT”). For CSL styles that require abbreviations, temporarily replace the journal field in the bib-file since CSL does not handle style-specific journal abbreviations (1). JSON-files containing journal abbreviations can be passed to pandoc using the citation-abbreviations field.\nInproceedings: when using crossrefs (e.g., crossref = {icis2010}) for conference papers, the year and month field should not be set, only the original @Proceedings entry should include the date formatted as follows: date    = {2015-12-13/2015-12-16}.\n\n{: .highlight } &gt; Literature summaries: Obsidian &gt; &gt; Literature summaries for each paper are stored in Obsidian format in the literature directory.",

    "text": "Cover letter\nExample 1: JOSS\nDear JOSS editors,\nI am pleased to submit the Python package BibDedupe for consideration and possible publication in the Journal of Open-Source Software. This submission addresses the clear need for effective software tailored to the detection of duplicates within bibliographic data.\nIn academic research, especially in areas involving meta-analysis and research synthesis, the accurate identification of duplicate bibliographic entries is essential. These duplicates, often resulting from the dissemination of a single study across multiple databases, can affect the integrity of research outcomes. Existing tools for deduplication generally do not cater adequately to the unique aspects of bibliographic data, which has very specific and idiosyncratic variations in authors’ names, publication titles, and source details. BibDedupe is designed to address these specific challenges, focusing on achieving zero false positives to ensure that each unique study is correctly represented in research summaries.\nOur development is informed by a comprehensive understanding of bibliographic data management and data quality requirements. It employs a detailed approach to data preprocessing, blocking, matching, and merging, offering efficiency and reproducibility in deduplicating bibliographic records. The performance of the package is particularly beneficial for researchers engaged in literature reviews involving large volumes of publications.\nBibDedupe is one of the first open-source tools in its domain that actively seeks peer review of its code. The field of literature review and meta-analysis software has long been dominated by proprietary and non-peer-reviewed tools, leading to a gap in the availability of rigorously evaluated, open-source options. By submitting BibDedupe to JOSS, we aim to raise standards in the field, encouraging the development of more rigorous, effective, and transparent tools for conducting literature reviews and meta-analyses. This effort aligns with a growing demand in the academic community for open-source tools that are not only functional but also validated through peer review.\nI believe BibDedupe will be a valuable contribution to the Journal of Open-Source Software, appealing to researchers looking for efficient and reliable bibliographic data management tools. I look forward to sharing more details in a paper to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\nBest regards,\nGerit Wagner",

    "text": "Instruction\nThis GPT acts as the Digital Work Lab Handbook Assistant, designed to accurately retrieve and interpret content from the Digital Work Lab handbook. It uses the handbook’s RAG index to determine which documents exist and only retrieves data from valid entries listed there. \n\nWhen users ask about handbook topics such as procedures, team, research, or teaching, the assistant looks up the RAG index to find the most relevant JSON or Markdown files and fetches the corresponding content through the appropriate `raw_url` or `get_section_rag` calls. It must not send requests to arbitrary paths or inferred URLs; it only queries those explicitly listed in the RAG index. If a requested document is missing, leads to a 404 error, or is not present in the index, the assistant informs the user clearly and suggests checking or updating the handbook structure.\n\nResponses must always reflect actual content retrieved from the valid source file. When a section contains multiple related documents (for example, several process files under `10-lab/10_processes/`), the assistant selects and summarizes the relevant files based on their titles and topics, and it can suggest related entries for context. If there are ambiguities, it asks clarifying questions to determine which indexed document(s) to reference.\n\nThe assistant’s tone remains respectful, mentoring, and collaborative. It supports users in interpreting procedures, understanding lab practices, and improving the handbook by suggesting edits or additions when inconsistencies or missing information arise. It always prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and contextual insight when guiding users through the Digital Work Lab handbook."

    "section": "Structure and Contents",
    "text": "Structure and Contents\nThe default structure outlined below may need to be adapted to the thesis or paper at hand. Each section has its own scope, as illustrated in the figure below. It is recommended to use active voice (“I” or “We”) instead of passive voice (commonly used in German).\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a research paper\n\n\nAbstract\nThe abstract acts as a point-of-entry for the reader, providing a first overview of the research study, namely, the motivation for the study, the methodological approach taken and a summary of the main results. In addition, the purpose of the research study should be clearly defined. Typically, an abstract consists of around 200 words.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction should precisely outline the purpose of the study as well as the research question that is sought to be answered. By briefly outlining the context of the study in terms of content and time, the reader acquires a quick overview. A key aspect of the introduction is the presentation of the motivation for conducting the study. This gives the reader a basic understanding of the topic and underpins the relevance and importance of the study. The relevance as well as the purpose can further be highlighted by using an appropriate quotation.\nThe building blocks of Lange an Pfarrer (2017) may be helpful:\n\nCommon Ground: Establishing common ground involves presenting the current state of the literature and ensuring that the reader is in agreement with the basic assumptions, boundary conditions, and key concepts. This step is crucial for gaining the reader’s interest and tacit consent, making them more receptive to the forthcoming arguments and discussions.\nComplication: After establishing common ground, introduce a complication that challenges the current understanding or highlights a gap in the literature. This complication could be a problem, puzzle, or twist that makes the reader realize the inadequacy or incompleteness of the existing academic conversation.\nConcern: To make the complication compelling, explain why it matters. This involves demonstrating the significance of the gap or issue identified. The concern step is about showing the practical and theoretical implications of the complication, emphasizing why it is essential to address this gap in the literature.\nCourse of Action: Describe the approach or methodology that will be used to address the identified complication. This could involve developing new constructs, modeling relationships, exploring processes, or synthesizing existing theories. The course of action should be clearly explained, logically structured, and directly aimed at resolving the complication.\nContribution: Finally, articulate how the research will contribute to the academic conversation. This entails explaining the novelty and significance of the findings and how they advance understanding in the field. The contribution should also suggest future theoretical exploration and practical implications for management and organizations.\n\nThe final paragraph of the introduction gives an outline of the structure of the study, that is, the approaches taken in each step of conducting the research study are briefly described. This gives the reader a clear picture of the composition of the study, i.e., what can and what cannot be expected of the study.\nBackground\nThis section (could also be named Literature Review or Conceptual Framework) sets the theoretical and conceptual context of the study and grounds the leading assumptions in theories. This is done by outlining and citing pertinent work. Here, the author can present the acquired background knowledge that is relevant for the following sections of the study. This background knowledge also helps in building the conceptual framework of the study.\nThe literature review should focus on concepts as opposed to authors and historical development (cf. Webster and Watson, 2002). It is also possible to use a conceptual framework to structure the literature synthesis. Provide precise definitions of those concepts that are central to your work, emphasize concepts rather than authors, and do not include your own judgment in the background section. Use established definitions and concepts and provide a justification when adapting them.\nA graphical representation of the framework helps to illustrate complex theoretical constructs as well as the boundaries of the research study. The explicit statement of the conceptual framework not just informs the reader, it also guides the author in conducting the research.\nRelevant background literature can be found in journals such as those listed in - the AIS Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals - the VHB Jourqual Ranking - or conferences such as ICIS and ECIS.\nPapers can be accessed through the Bamberger Katalog, a search on Researchgate, a search on Google, or by contacting the authors.\nGuidelines on searching the literature are provided by Webster and Watson (2002).\nMethodology\nThe methodology section describes a systematic and goal-oriented approach to answer the research question. Hence, the selection of the research method needs to be consistent with the research questions. The approach may be, for example, empirical, analytical, comparative, systematic, historic, or hermeneutic (Goethe Universität). The methodological approach needs to be described in detail; appropriate reporting standards for the research method should be considered (such as PRISMA for literature reviews); it should be possible to understand the methodological procedures based on the thesis. For example, it is necessary to provide the formulas of regression models.\nResults\nIn this section, the author presents the results of the study. In case they are presented by means of figures and/or tables, the results should be clearly legible. Furthermore, in the case of figures, it is recommended to use vector graphics as this ensures good readability without the need to pre-specify the font size within the figures. An example figure and table can be found in the template contained in this repository.\nDiscussion\nIn this section, the author provides a discussion of the results and is thus able to draw an informed conclusion. More precisely, the discussion is an evaluative summary of the research study in relation to the research question. In general, the discussion can be divided in three parts. First, the results should be tied to the research question, thus presenting the reader a solution or improvement to the identified problem space. Here, for example, the author can draw on empirical findings introduced in the Results section to support his or her argument. Next, the author should outline the limitations of the research study by critically examining the used research approach. Limitations might comprise, for example, a limited time frame considered in the research study, or the individual refinement of a specific research method due to time constraints. Finally, suggestions for future research avenues should be provided. These suggestions may be in line with the limitations, as this allows other researchers to build on the present work by extending or analyzing it. In summary, the Discussion section presents the results in relation to the research question as well as restrictions of the study and suggestions for future research in the respective domain.\nConclusion\nThe conclusion contains a summary of the research study. In contrast to the Discussion section, in which the main results are presented, here the key contributions of the work are showcased. A well-crafted conclusion answers the research question stated in the Introduction. By so doing, the author clarifies to what extent the research study has presented a solution or improvement to the examined problem space.\nDeclarations\nThis section may contain an “Availability of data, materials, and code” statement (e.g., linking to a GitHub repository or a digital appendix), and acknowledgements.",

    "text": "Style\nThe style guide of Strunk & White (1999) summarizes many instructive recommendations.\n\nWriting concisely\nWrite as concisely as possible, avoiding general statements, such as:\n\n“There is a research gap.” - State what the gap is specifically and why it is important to address it.\n“Current knowledge is insufficient.” - State for what purpose current knowledge is insufficient.\n\n\n\nTense\nPresent Tense\n\nUse for general truths, facts, and accepted knowledge\n(e.g., “Water boils at 100°C”).\nDescribe what the paper does or contains\n(e.g., “This study investigates…” or “The results indicate…”).\nRefer to figures, tables, or conclusions in the paper\n(e.g., “Figure 1 shows…”).\n\nPast Tense\n\nDescribe specific methods or experiments conducted\n(e.g., “We analyzed the data using SPSS”).\nReport specific results or findings from the study\n(e.g., “The analysis revealed a significant correlation”).\nRefer to prior research\n(e.g., “Smith et al. (2020) found…”).\n\n\n\nTopic sentences\nTo write in a clear manner, it is helpful to focus on topic sentences (first sentence of each paragraph, which gives a clear outline of what is covered in the paragraph). Good examples of topic sentences can be found in top-tier journal papers like the one of Davis (1989):\n\nPerceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use\nWhat causes people to acceptor reject information technology? Among the many variables that may influence system use, previous research suggests two determinants that are especially important. First, people tend to use or not use an application to the extent they believe it will help them perform their job better. We refer to this first variable as perceived usefulness. Second, even if potential users believe that a given application is useful, they may, at the same time, believe that the systems is too hard to use and that the performance benefits of usage are outweighed by the effort of using the application. That is, in addition to usefulness, usage is theorized to be influenced by perceived ease of use.\nPerceived usefulness is defined here as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance.” This follows from the definition of the word useful: “capable of being used advantageously.” Within an organizational context, people are generally reinforced for good performance by raises, promotions, bonuses, and other rewards (Pfeffer, 1982; Schein,1980; Vroom,1964). A system high in perceived usefulness, in turn, is one for which a user believes in the existence of a positive use-performance relationship.\nPerceived ease of use, in contrast, refers to “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort.” This follows from the definition of “ease”: “freedom from difficulty or great effort.” Effort is a finite resource that a person may allocate to the various activities for which he or she is responsible (Radner and Rothschild, 1975). All else being equal, we claim, an application perceived to be easier to use than another is more likely to be accepted by users.\n\n\n\nConcept-centric style\nEspecially in related work sections, it can be tempting to summarize one study after another. This author-centric style can be hard to read because it often fails to explain how the concepts and findings of studies are related. A concept-centric style can be more effective to organize prior research\n\nExample of an author-centric style\nAuthor A (2001) has studied the acceptance of group support systems and found positive effects on group performance. Author B (2002) has studied expert systems at IBM and found mixed effects on organizational performance. Author C (2003) has surveyed executives and documented diverging views on the benefits of decision support systems.\nExample of a concept-centric style\nPrior research has examined the effect of decision support systems on various outcomes. There are multiple studies reporting consistent and positive effects on organizational performance (Author A 2001, Author B 2002). In contrast, effects on individual performance were mixed. Studies that measured performance objectively tended to report positive effects (Author C 2020, Author D 2021), while studies of perceived performance did not report significant effects (Author E 2005, Author D 2006).\n\nWebster and Watson (2001) provide advice on constructing a concept matrix.",

    "text": "Citations and reference sections\nCiting allows us to make the results of others understandable and give proper recognition to the authors. There are two main reasons why we cite: firstly, to respect copyrighted works, and secondly, to adhere to the principles of good scientific practice by appropriately acknowledging the contributions of others.\nIn information systems or computer science, indirect citation is usually used, as it is more about the theories, studies and results and not about the direct wording.\nThe following examples use Markdown syntax. For docx formats, please use a reference manager plugin (such as Zotero).\nYour reference manager should support the standardized citation styles of csl.\nIn-text citations\nIn-text citations can be parenthetical or narrative (see APA style).\n\nExample parenthetical citation: Fitness trackers were found to have mixed effects on sedentary behavior (Smith et al. 2006).\nExample narrative citation: Smith et al. (2006) analyzed the effectiveness of fitness trackers.\n\nWord-for-word quotations (parenthetical or narrative) must be identified by quotation marks and a page number must be given:\n\nExample word-for-word quotation: For fitness trackers, \"a substantial degree of inaccuracy in measuring sleep quality\" was found (Smith et al. 2006, p.111):\n\nParenthetical citations tend to be preferred over narrative citations because they put more emphasis on the content, concepts, or findings instead of the authors.\nIn markdown, parenthetical in-text citations are created based on the [@author2000;@author2010] syntax while narrative in-text citations are created based on the @author2000 syntax (link). The unique IDs (e.g., author2000) are used to link citations to the corresponding elements in the BibTeX file.\nIn the Reference Bib\nReferences should be as complete as possible, including the relevant fields. Each reference should be listed once (not multiple times). Examples with relevant fields are summarized below.\n{: .highlight } &gt; Checklist for BibTeX files &gt; &gt; - ENTRYTYPE set correctly (e.g., “article” or “inproceedings”) &gt; - author formatted correctly (Wagner, G. and Prester, J.) &gt; - title complete and in lower case &gt; - journal field complete and in title case &gt; - volume, number, pages, doi fields added\n\nJournal articles\n\n@article{LeeAnderson2001,\n    doi                = {10.1006/COGP.2000.0747},\n    author             = {Anderson, John R},\n    journal            = {Cognitive Psychology},\n    title              = {Does learning a complex task},\n    year               = {2001},\n    volume             = {42},\n    number             = {3},\n    pages              = {267--316},\n}\n\nConference Papers\n\n@inproceedings{LeeAnderson2001,\n    author             = {Weber, Matthias and Remus, Ulrich and Pregenzer, Michael},\n    booktitle          = {Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Systems},\n    title              = {A New Era of Control: Understanding Algorithmic Control in the Gig Economy},\n    year               = {2022},\n}\n\nBooks:\n\n@book{Kolb2014,\n    author             = {Kolb, David A},\n    title              = {Experiential learning},\n    year               = {2014},\n    publisher          = {FT press},\n}\n\nEssays in collected editions:\n\n@incollection{Anderson1984a,\n    author             = {Anderson, Richard C},\n    booktitle          = {Theoretical models},\n    title              = {Role of the reader's schema in comprehension, learning, and memory},\n    year               = {2018},\n    pages              = {136--145},\n    publisher          = {Routledge},\n}\n\nWebsites\n\n@online{Microsoft2018,\n    author             = {Microsoft News Center},\n    title              = {Microsoft to acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion},\n    year               = {2018},\n    url                = {https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/},\n}\nFor URLs, use the complete WWW address including the transmission protocol (usually “http://”) in lower case (unless upper case is mandatory for the retrieval).\n\nTo cite software, datasets and other artifacts, CiteAs is useful.\n\nProgram that can be used for citation is “Zotero”.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background Prospective physicians are expected to find artificial intelligence (AI) to be a key technology in their future practice. This transformative change has caught the attention of scientists, educators, and policy makers alike, with substantive efforts dedicated to the selection and delivery of AI topics and competencies in the medical curriculum. Less is known about the behavioral perspective or the necessary and sufficient preconditions for medical students’ intention to use AI in the first place. Objective Our study focused on medical students’ knowledge, experience, attitude, and beliefs related to AI and aimed to understand whether they are necessary conditions and form sufficient configurations of conditions associated with behavioral intentions to use AI in their future medical practice. Methods We administered a 2-staged questionnaire operationalizing the variables of interest (ie, knowledge, experience, attitude, and beliefs related to AI, as well as intention to use AI) and recorded 184 responses at t0 (February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 138 responses at t1 (January 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic). Following established guidelines, we applied necessary condition analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to analyze the data. Results Findings from the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis show that the intention to use AI is only observed when students have a strong belief in the role of AI (individually necessary condition); certain AI profiles, that is, combinations of knowledge and experience, attitudes and beliefs, and academic level and gender, are always associated with high intentions to use AI (equifinal and sufficient configurations); and profiles associated with nonhigh intentions cannot be inferred from profiles associated with high intentions (causal asymmetry). Conclusions Our work contributes to prior knowledge by showing that a strong belief in the role of AI in the future of medical professions is a necessary condition for behavioral intentions to use AI. Moreover, we suggest that the preparation of medical students should go beyond teaching AI competencies and that educators need to account for the different AI profiles associated with high or nonhigh intentions to adopt AI.\n\n\n  Article / DOI link    Open access PDF \n\n\n\n\nAppendix / supplementary materials: https://github.com/digital-work-lab/fsQCA-physicians-intention-to-use-AI\n\n\n\n\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Although off‐the‐shelf enterprise systems (ES) have been widely adopted in organisations, the extant literature repeatedly documents ES failures caused by misfits between organisational processes and the ES. Although some misfits can be identified early in the ES lifecycle, others emerge in the onward and upward phase (i.e., after the implementation) and, hence, must be resolved reactively. Prior research on misfits and resolution strategies has primarily focused on the implementation phase, often assuming that close‐to‐perfect information on the misfit’s nature and characteristics is available. However, no study has examined how to effectively complete a shared diagnosis and resolution of misfits when diverging individual user perceptions are taken as the starting point. Such situations may be particularly pronounced in pluralistic organisations, where a variety of interdependent processes and potentially competing perceptions of processes are prevalent. The main objective of this study is to address this gap. To this end, we propose a pragmatic method for the diagnosis and resolution of misfits between organisational processes and enterprise systems, which builds on an actionable conceptualization of misfits. This method builds on theoretical concepts of affordances, affordance actualization, user participation, and change agentry. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted an action research study in a university hospital. Our analysis focused on a specific misfit involving the hospital’s ES‐supported clinical processes. The findings suggest that the method effectively diagnoses and resolves misfits and optimises the resources required for their resolution through efficient management of user participation.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background The COVID-19 crisis has drastically changed care delivery with teleconsultation platforms experiencing substantial spikes in demand, helping patients and care providers avoid infections and maintain health care services. Beyond the current pandemic, teleconsultation is considered a significant opportunity to address persistent health system challenges, including accessibility, continuity, and cost of care, while ensuring quality. Objective This study aims at identifying the determinants of patients’ intention to continue using a teleconsultation platform. It extends prior research on information technology use continuance intention and teleconsultation services. Methods Data was collected in November 2018 and May 2019 with Canadian patients who had access to a teleconsultation platform. Measures included patients’ intention to continue their use; teleconsultation usefulness; teleconsultation quality; patients’ trust toward the digital platform, its provider. and health care professionals; and confirmation of patients’ expectations toward teleconsultation. We used structural equation modeling employing the partial least squares component-based technique to test our research model and hypotheses. Results We analyzed a sample of 178 participants who had used teleconsultation services. Our findings revealed that confirmation of expectations had the greatest influence on continuance intention (total effects=0.722; P&lt;.001), followed by usefulness (total effects=0.587; P&lt;.001) and quality (total effects=0.511; P&lt;.001). Usefulness (β=.60; P&lt;.001) and quality (β=.34; P=.01) had direct effects on the dependent variable. The confirmation of expectations had direct effects both on usefulness (β=.56; P&lt;.001) and quality (β=.75; P&lt;.001) in addition to having an indirect effect on usefulness (indirect effects=0.282; P&lt;.001). Last, quality directly influenced usefulness (β=.34; P=.002) and trust (β=.88; P&lt;.001). Trust does not play a role in the context under study. Conclusions Teleconsultation is central to care going forward, and it represents a significant lever for an improved, digital delivery of health care in the future. We believe that our findings will help drive long-term teleconsultation adoption and use, including in the aftermath of the current COVID-19 crisis, so that general care improvement and greater preparedness for exceptional situations can be achieved.\n\n\n  Article / DOI link    Open access PDF \n\n\n\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

Beyond the current pandemic, teleconsultation is considered a significant opportunity to address persistent health system challenges, including accessibility, continuity, and cost of care, while ensuring quality. Objective This study aims at identifying the determinants of patients’ intention to continue using a teleconsultation platform. It extends prior research on information technology use continuance intention and teleconsultation services. Methods Data was collected in November 2018 and May 2019 with Canadian patients who had access to a teleconsultation platform. Measures included patients’ intention to continue their use; teleconsultation usefulness; teleconsultation quality; patients’ trust toward the digital platform, its provider. and health care professionals; and confirmation of patients’ expectations toward teleconsultation. We used structural equation modeling employing the partial least squares component-based technique to test our research model and hypotheses. Results We analyzed a sample of 178 participants who had used teleconsultation services. Our findings revealed that confirmation of expectations had the greatest influence on continuance intention (total effects=0.722; P&lt;.001), followed by usefulness (total effects=0.587; P&lt;.001) and quality (total effects=0.511; P&lt;.001). Usefulness (β=.60; P&lt;.001) and quality (β=.34; P=.01) had direct effects on the dependent variable. The confirmation of expectations had direct effects both on usefulness (β=.56; P&lt;.001) and quality (β=.75; P&lt;.001) in addition to having an indirect effect on usefulness (indirect effects=0.282; P&lt;.001). Last, quality directly influenced usefulness (β=.34; P=.002) and trust (β=.88; P&lt;.001). Trust does not play a role in the context under study. Conclusions Teleconsultation is central to care going forward, and it represents a significant lever for an improved, digital delivery of health care in the future. We believe that our findings will help drive long-term teleconsultation adoption and use, including in the aftermath of the current COVID-19 crisis, so that general care improvement and greater preparedness for exceptional situations can be achieved.}\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today, organizations must deal with a plethora of IT security threats and to ensure smooth and uninterrupted business operations, firms are challenged to predict the volume of IT security vulnerabilities and allocate resources for fixing them. This challenge requires decision makers to assess which system or software packages are prone to vulnerabilities, how many post-release vulnerabilities can be expected to occur during a certain period of time, and what impact exploits might have. Substantial research has been dedicated to techniques that analyze source code and detect security vulnerabilities. However, only limited research has focused on forecasting security vulnerabilities that are detected and reported after the release of software. To address this shortcoming, we apply established methodologies which are capable of forecasting events exhibiting specific time series characteristics of security vulnerabilities, i.e., rareness of occurrence, volatility, non-stationarity, and seasonality. Based on a dataset taken from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the forecasting accuracy of single, double, and triple exponential smoothing methodologies, Croston’s methodology, ARIMA, and a neural network-based approach. We analyze the impact of the applied forecasting methodology on the prediction accuracy with regard to its robustness along the dimensions of the examined system and software package “operating systems”, “browsers” and “office solutions” and the applied metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the effect of forecasting methodologies and to apply metrics that are suitable in this context.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in health care are on the agenda of policymakers around the world, but a major challenge remains, namely, to set policies that will ensure wide acceptance and capture the value of AI while mitigating associated risks. Objective This study aims to provide an overview of how OECD countries strategize about how to integrate AI into health care and to determine their actual level of AI maturity. Methods A scan of government-based AI strategies and initiatives adopted in 10 proactive OECD countries was conducted. Available documentation was analyzed, using the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development’s roadmap to AI maturity as a conceptual framework. Results The findings reveal that most selected OECD countries are at the Emerging stage (Level 2) of AI in health maturity.

In this context, prospective physicians will play a key role in adopting and applying AI-based health technologies, underlining the importance of understanding their knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward AI. To dissociate corresponding profiles, we adopted a configurational perspective and conducted a two-stage survey study of 184 (t_0) and 138 (t_1) medical students at a Canadian medical school. Our principal findings corroborate the existence of distinct clusters in respondents’ AI profiles. We refer to these profiles as the AI unfamiliar, the AI educated, and the AI positive, showing that each profile is associated with different intentions towards future AI use. These exploratory insights on the variety of AI profiles in prospective physicians underline the need for targeted and adaptive measures of education and outreach.}\n}"

Yet, we observe a lack of theoretical underpinning of and epistemological insights into how literature reviews can contribute to knowledge creation and have actually contributed in the IS discipline. To address these theoretical and empirical research gaps, we suggest a novel epistemological model of literature reviews. This model allows us to align different contributions of literature reviews with their underlying knowledge conversions - thereby building a bridge between the previously largely unconnected fields of literature reviews and epistemology. We evaluate the appropriateness of the model by conducting an empirical analysis of 173 IS literature reviews which were published in 39 pertinent IS journals between 2000 and 2014.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since its inception, the Information Systems discipline has been striving to develop impactful papers that contribute to cumulative knowledge development. Yet, there is a surprising lack of insights on how scientific impact can be accomplished and to which extent this impact represents a substantial engagement with, and extension of the knowledge contributions of the original papers. Especially for review articles and design science research, there are both competing conceptions of what makes these papers impactful and a lack of empirical evidence that would inform this debate. Furthermore, there is a latent skepticism as to whether this sometimes staggering impact of review articles actually represents knowledge development. In a similar way, it is unclear how and to which extent design science research has stimulated meaningful, cumulative knowledge development in information systems. The goal of this thesis is therefore to (1) explain and to (2) distinguish the scientific impact of review articles and design science research. Specifically, the first goal considers overall scientific impact as the dependent variable whose association with antecedent factors is analyzed by regression methodologies. The second goal zooms in on the concept of scientific impact and considers it as a relation between citing and cited papers that is explored through methodologies of manual content analysis and machine- learning classification.With Paper 1, I develop the foundation of knowledge development through review articles by crystallizing their contributions and aligning them with their underlying knowledge conver- sion processes in an overarching framework. This framework is based on the abstraction and codification of knowledge and thereby integrates two essential dimensions of knowledge devel- opment. Overall, the foundation developed in the first paper informs the underlying conception of knowledge development of both review articles and citing papers.Addressing the first goal, Papers 2 and 3 develop and test scientometric impact models ex- plaining the scientific impact of review articles and design science research, respectively. Beyond common control variables related to the journal and author level, they offer distinct insights for each type of paper. For review articles, I identify strong effects related to methodological transparency and the development of a research agenda, which vary depending on the type of review. For design science research, I show that theorization and novelty drive scientific impact.Concerning the second goal, Papers 4 and 5 distinguish different types of scientific impact of review articles and design science research, respectively. To analyze the different types of impact that review articles have on their overwhelming number of citing papers, I develop machine learning classifiers. Specifically, I distinguish ideational impact, which corresponds to a substantial engagement with and development of the knowledge contributions of the review article, from perfunctory impact, which corresponds to more trivial connections to the review article. In a similar, though not automated way, I analyze the types of impact of information systems design theories, a particular type of design science research. These analyses primarily focus on whether follow-up research tests and extends these theories. Based on our content analysis, I identify an alarming paucity of follow-up research in this area and develop specific guidelines for the design science community to address this challenge.The thesis concludes with an overview of the research contributions, implications for research practice, future research opportunities, and final remarks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWagner, G.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background Unhealthy behaviors, such as physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthful eating, remain highly prevalent, posing formidable challenges in efforts to improve cardiovascular health. While traditional interventions to promote healthy lifestyles are both costly and effective, wearable trackers, especially Fitbit devices, can provide a low-cost alternative that may effectively help large numbers of individuals become more physically fit and thereby maintain a good health status. Objective The objectives of this meta-analysis are (1) to assess the effectiveness of interventions that incorporate a Fitbit device for healthy lifestyle outcomes (eg, steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and weight) and (2) to identify which additional intervention components or study characteristics are the most effective at improving healthy lifestyle outcomes. Methods A systematic review was conducted, searching the following databases from 2007 to 2019: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL (Cochrane). Studies were included if (1) they were randomized controlled trials, (2) the intervention involved the use of a Fitbit device, and (3) the reported outcomes were related to healthy lifestyles. The main outcome measures were related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and weight. All the studies were assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the treatment effect of interventions that included a Fitbit device compared with a control group. We also conducted subgroup analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to further disentangle the effects of intervention components. Results Our final sample comprised 41 articles reporting the results of 37 studies. For Fitbit-based interventions, we found a statistically significant increase in daily step count (mean difference [MD] 950.54, 95% CI 475.89-1425.18; P&lt;.001) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MD 6.16, 95% CI 2.80-9.51; P&lt;.001), a significant decrease in weight (MD −1.48, 95% CI −2.81 to −0.14; P=.03), and a nonsignificant decrease in objectively assessed and self-reported sedentary behavior (MD −10.62, 95% CI −35.50 to 14.27; P=.40 and standardized MD −0.11, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.26; P=.56, respectively). In general, the included studies were at low risk for bias, except for performance bias. Subgroup analysis and fsQCA demonstrated that, in addition to the effects of the Fitbit devices, setting activity goals was the most important intervention component. Conclusions The use of Fitbit devices in interventions has the potential to promote healthy lifestyles in terms of physical activity and weight. Fitbit devices may be useful to health professionals for patient monitoring and support.

Studies were included if (1) they were randomized controlled trials, (2) the intervention involved the use of a Fitbit device, and (3) the reported outcomes were related to healthy lifestyles. The main outcome measures were related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and weight. All the studies were assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the treatment effect of interventions that included a Fitbit device compared with a control group. We also conducted subgroup analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to further disentangle the effects of intervention components. Results Our final sample comprised 41 articles reporting the results of 37 studies. For Fitbit-based interventions, we found a statistically significant increase in daily step count (mean difference [MD] 950.54, 95% CI 475.89-1425.18; P&lt;.001) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MD 6.16, 95% CI 2.80-9.51; P&lt;.001), a significant decrease in weight (MD −1.48, 95% CI −2.81 to −0.14; P=.03), and a nonsignificant decrease in objectively assessed and self-reported sedentary behavior (MD −10.62, 95% CI −35.50 to 14.27; P=.40 and standardized MD −0.11, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.26; P=.56, respectively). In general, the included studies were at low risk for bias, except for performance bias. Subgroup analysis and fsQCA demonstrated that, in addition to the effects of the Fitbit devices, setting activity goals was the most important intervention component. Conclusions The use of Fitbit devices in interventions has the potential to promote healthy lifestyles in terms of physical activity and weight. Fitbit devices may be useful to health professionals for patient monitoring and support.

    "text": "Steps of the Process\n\n1. Study the review package\n\nStep Back: After receiving the review package, take a break to calm any emotional reactions. This helps in assimilating feedback more objectively.\nReflect: Spend a few days reflecting on the feedback without making any immediate changes to the manuscript.\nCreate a Revision Sheet: For teams collaborating in Markdown, a structured Markdown document is recommended along with corresponding branches for the revisions (see LLM prompt below). For teams collaborating in Word, a Word table is recommended.\n\n\n\n2. Develop a Holistic Understanding of the Feedback\n\nCategorize Issues: Organize feedback into categories such as motivation, theorization, research design, analysis, and implications.\nIdentify Disagreements: Note areas where reviewers agree or disagree, and prioritize addressing the most critical points. e ### 3. Formulate a Revision Strategy\nConsider Alternatives: Think about different ways to address major issues and evaluate the implications of each approach.\nEvaluate Coherence: Ensure that the revised manuscript tells a cohesive and credible story, with changes that enhance the overall plot.\nDraft a strategy: Based on the revision sheet, note which issues are connected, how and in which order they will be addressed, and by whom.\n\n\n\n4. Rewrite the Paper\n\nAvoid Rewriting Block: Start afresh rather than tweaking the old draft to encourage rethinking and reorganization.\nIterate and Present: Alternate between thinking, writing, and presenting to gather feedback and refine your manuscript.\n\n\n\n5. Write the Response Document\n\nLead with the Big Picture: Summarize how major issues were addressed and how the storyline has developed.\nPoint-by-Point Responses: Explain your choices in addressing each issue and refer to specific sections in the manuscript where changes were made.\nInclude Additional Evidence: Provide supplementary information that may not fit into the manuscript but addresses reviewers’ concerns.\n\n\n\n6. Start Early and Establish a Timeline\n\nSchedule Activities: Allocate specific times for revision tasks and ensure collaboration with co-authors is well-coordinated.\nRefine: Dedicate time towards the end of the revision process to polish the manuscript and response document.\n\n{: .info } &gt; Contradicting review packages &gt; &gt; If the review panel makes contradicting suggestions and the AE does not offer guidance, it may be helpful to meet with the SE, discuss the options, make a decision and refer to that in the response (see IS research podcast).",

These aspects relate to the significance of the proposed approach against the background of the rapid evolution of generative AI tools. The authors mention that AI use is currently viewed as misconduct. What mechanisms were in place to identify such use? There is also a possibility that learners used AI not to produce answers but as a tutor to build understanding before class. Thus, generative AI could increase the baseline knowledge of those who use it. The authors need to offer ideas on how to evaluate the impact of the course on learner competency in light of AI. At present, the focus is on learner feedback. The authors might consider whether assessing baseline knowledge, teamwork aptitude, and AI usage habits is key to understanding true course effectiveness.\nWe thank the reviewer for this encouraging feedback and the opportunity to revise our manuscript. As noted, it is not possible to reliably confirm AI use through output inspection alone; instead, we rely on structured rules and testing to evaluate individual understanding without AI support. We also reiterate our earlier position that AI can serve as a valuable tutor when used to support, rather than replace, learning.\n\n\nR1.2\n…\n…\n\n\n\n{: .info } &gt; References to reviewers and editors &gt; &gt; In the response, we can refer to the AE (short for associate editor) or SE (senior editor) or R1 (reviewer 1). &gt; In addition, we may refer to specific comments, such as R2.4 (the 4th comment of reviewer 2).",

If students notice any discrepancies, they can write down their observations on a separate piece of paper and take pictures.\nAfter the reviewing days, students can send an email to the responsible chair and request a correction, but only if they can specifically identify the questions and provide a picture of the exam task that requires correction.\nAfterwards, the chair determines whether a post-correction is necessary based on the description and picture, and informs the student via email.\n\n\n\nProcedure - Chair\n\nWhen the chair receives a student’s correction request, the respective exam has to be requested at the examination office (E-Mail to: registratur.pruefungen@uni-bamberg.de, including student’s name and matriculation number).\nAfter arrival at the chair, the exam will then be post-corrected by the professor/lecturer. When points or grade change, incorrect points or grade are to be crossed out, correct points and grade stated, together with date, stamp and signature (on the exam cover/Prüfungsumschlag).\nWhen a grade changes, scan the first page of the exam (indicating the new grade) and save it in 14.01\nThe exam is then sent back to the examination office, which carries our a possible change of grades in FlexNow.",

Strict rules can have several advantages, such as (1) setting clear expectations, (2) reducing free-riding, or (3) allowing instructors to be more supportive instead of disciplining students. For example:\n\nIn the open-source project, the rule is that students only participate if they contribute actual code to the group project. Students know that they are expected to contribute code before a predefined deadline and that the contributions will be checked. Given that students are not assigned to a group and do not receive a grade without contributing code, free-riding (having the others work without putting in much effort) is limited. In addition, students may take proactive ownership of their work, and ask instructors and teaching assistants for help. This allows us to play a more supportive role, instead of trying to discipline students towards the end of the project.",

For example, there should always be a specific repository containing the current version of a research paper, along with the version history, ongoing work in branches or pull requests and open issues. We try to avoid sending direct messages and documents as much as possible. Collaborating in these repositories has many benefits: repositories provide context (clearly identifying the project, its history, ongoing work, and open issues), allow us to reduce direct messages (the cognitive effort to search for related documents and coordinate asynchronous work), and use scripts like Labot for automation.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n\n    subgraph task[\"III.

Issues offer a continuous thread for a given task with several advantages:\n\n\n\nAll task-related information is collected in one place\n\n\nWe can link other resources or upload files\n\n\nWe can mention others (e.g., (geritwagner?): can you help me with …?), asking them to contribute\n\n\nWe can work on shared issues with colleagues, but also with external stakeholders, such as researchers from other universities or students\n\n\nIssues can be linked to pull requests\n\n\nWe can share (deep) links to issues, giving recipients context on the task (unlike e-mails where finding context can be time-consuming)\n\n\nGitHub offers templates to structure recurring tasks\n\n\nIt is easy to write scripts that access, create, or contribute to issues\n\n\nClosed issues offer a historical record of past decisions and work procedures\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n\n\nCarefully decide in which repository the issues should be created. Issues are specific to a repository and have the same visibility (private or public).\n\n\nMention colleagues instead of writing a separate e-mail.\n\n\nRegularly check GitHub’s overview of all open issues assigned to you or with mentions.\n\n\n\nSharing with deep links\n\n\nA deep link is a URL that points directly to specific content within a page, rather than to the general page or document itself. This allows users to access the exact information or context they need without having to navigate or search within the broader resource.\n\n\nExamples of deep links:\n\n\n\nSpecific element in our handbook: https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/20-research/20_processes/20.32.revision.html#expected-outcome\n\n\nSelected slide in our project: https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/output/05-best_practice.html#technical-setup\n\n\nA comment in an issue discussion: https://github.com/digital-work-lab/digital-work-lecture/issues/8#issuecomment-2199793685\n\n\n\nHow to create a deep link:\n\n\n\nClick on the anchor and copy the URL:\n\n\n\nIn slides, add the title after the #:\n\n\n\nWhy Use Deep Links\n\n\nPrecision and Clarity: Deep links provide targeted access to relevant content, which reduces ambiguity and ensures recipients understand the exact context being referenced.\n\n\nImproved Collaboration: Sharing specific parts of documents or discussions encourages grounded and focused discussions, avoiding the inefficiency of reading or interpreting an entire document.\n\n\nAsynchronous Workflows: Deep links support modern collaborative practices by making resources easy to share, revisit, and update over time without additional explanation or redundant actions.\n\n\nEnhanced Discoverability: They create a networked “knowledge graph,” allowing users to explore related information seamlessly through interconnected resources.\n\n\nTime and Effort Savings: By bypassing the need to search within a page, deep links save time for all collaborators.\n\n\n\nSee Ben Balter’s post.\n\n\nSharing contents and research results\n\n\n\nWork iteratively: Always write and share bullet points before writing paragraphs.\n\n\nAgree on short names for research projects: For example, use names like BibDedupe or GitIntro. Short names should be related to the topic, not the target journal (avoid referring to “the MISQ paper”).\n\n\nTo facilitate sharing, ensure that projects, contents, and processes are linkable and editable (e.g., in a thesis repository on GitHub, a link to the meeting notes can be shared, and thesis advisors can directly suggest modifications).\n\n\nQuestions related to our processes should be answered by sharing a link instead of answering the same question multiple times (e.g., here are our guidelines for creating markdown slides).\n\n\nBefore the publication of results, research data (including code, interview data, and manuscripts) should be kept private.\n\n\nCoordinate with your team on whether and when a shared repository will be available to the public and set a clear time frame to avoid misunderstandings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTODO : add examples, link items in the figure",
