    "text": "Rules and Classroom Management\nRules affect student behavior and teaching conditions. Strict rules can have several advantages, such as (1) setting clear expectations, (2) reducing free-riding, or (3) allowing instructors to be more supportive instead of disciplining students. For example:\n\nIn the open-source project, the rule is that students only participate if they contribute actual code to the group project. Students know that they are expected to contribute code before a predefined deadline and that the contributions will be checked. Given that students are not assigned to a group and do not receive a grade without contributing code, free-riding (having the others work without putting in much effort) is limited. In addition, students may take proactive ownership of their work, and ask instructors and teaching assistants for help. This allows us to play a more supportive role, instead of trying to discipline students towards the end of the project.",

    "text": "Steps of the process\n\n1. Admin\n\nForward decision to coauthors and clarify who leads the revision\nUpdate status and history in data/projects.yaml.\n\n\n\n2. Study the review package\n\nStep back: After receiving the review package, take a break to calm any emotional reactions. This helps in assimilating feedback more objectively.\nReflect: Spend a few days reflecting on the feedback without making any immediate changes to the manuscript.\nCreate a revision sheet: For teams collaborating in Markdown, a structured Markdown document is recommended along with corresponding branches for the revisions (see LLM prompt below). For teams collaborating in Word, a Word table is recommended. (see creating a revision sheet)\n\n\n\n3. Develop a holistic understanding of the feedback\n\nCategorize issues: Organize feedback into categories such as motivation, theorization, research design, analysis, and implications.\nIdentify disagreements: Note areas where reviewers agree or disagree, and prioritize addressing the most critical points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteContradicting review packages\n\n\n\nIf the review panel makes contradicting suggestions and the AE does not offer guidance, it may be helpful to meet with the SE, discuss the options, make a decision, and refer to that in the response (see IS research podcast).\n\n\n\n\n4. Formulate a revision strategy\n\nConsider alternatives: Think about different ways to address major issues and evaluate the implications of each approach.\nEvaluate coherence: Ensure that the revised manuscript tells a cohesive and credible story, with changes that enhance the overall plot.\nDraft a strategy: Based on the revision sheet, note which issues are connected, how and in which order they will be addressed, and by whom.\n\n\n\n5. Rewrite the paper\n\nAvoid rewriting block: Start afresh rather than tweaking the old draft to encourage rethinking and reorganization.\nIterate and present: Alternate between thinking, writing, and presenting to gather feedback and refine your manuscript.\n\n\n\n6. Write the response document\n\nLead with the big picture: Summarize how major issues were addressed and how the storyline has developed.\nPoint-by-point responses: Explain your choices in addressing each issue and refer to specific sections in the manuscript where changes were made.\nInclude additional evidence: Provide supplementary information that may not fit into the manuscript but addresses reviewers’ concerns.\n\n\n\n7. Start early and establish a timeline\n\nSchedule activities: Allocate specific times for revision tasks and ensure collaboration with co-authors is well-coordinated.\nRefine: Dedicate time towards the end of the revision process to polish the manuscript and response document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExpected outcome\n\n\n\nA well-revised manuscript that:\n\nDemonstrates a comprehensive response to reviewers’ feedback.\nPresents a cohesive and enhanced storyline.\nCommunicates changes clearly and professionally.\nAddresses major critiques holistically while considering minor comments effectively.\nReflects a thorough rethinking and restructuring rather than superficial adjustments.\n\nA point-by-point response to the comments (AE1, …, R1.1, …) explaining how the paper was revised:\n# Revision document\n\n## AE1\n\nComment 1 provided by the AE ....\n\n&gt; Our response ...\n\n## AE2\n\n&gt; Our response ...\n\n...\nThe markdown document will be converted to a revision table before submission:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\nReviewer comment\nResponse and action taken\n\n\n\n\nR1.1\nHowever, the authors need to clarify some aspects.

In Git, we create revision documents as a list of comments and responses, structured according to comment IDs.

When following the standard format, a revision table can be generated at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResourceResource\n\n\n\n📺 video demo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDo not use public LLMs without the team’s consent. Check the results meticulously. Large review packages may not be transferred completely.\n\n\nThe following prompt can be used to create a revision sheet based on feedback documents (input):\nRemove unnecessary line breaks and add new lines to clarify the structure of paragraphs and reviewers.\nDo not add headings, and do not modify the content. Give markdown as a result.\n\n🚨 **Append review package** 🚨\n\nVersion, compare and add with gitk\nRemove unnecessary markup/text\nPre-structure the SE/AE section\nIf there are any references, extract them as BibTeX\n\nNext prompt:\nStructure the review package by adding markers such as \"# R1.2\" (for comment 2 of reviewer 1) or \n\"# SE1\" (for comment 1 of the senior editor) in separate lines (surrounded by empty lines) and \nadding a quote \"Response ...\" afterward. Do not remove or modify contents. Do not change markup.\nMake sure that each issue raised by the review panel has its own number (marker and response). \n\nFor example, an input like this: \"\"\nReviewer 1\n\nThank you for the opportunity to review this paper.\n\n**Clarity**. The following parts need clarification ....\n\n**Contribution**. Please articulate your contribution to prior research.\n\nThank you...\n\n\"\"\n\nWould be transformed to:\"\"\n\n# R1.1\n\nThank you for the opportunity to review this paper.\n\n&gt; Response: ...\n\n# R1.2\n\n**Clarity**.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background Unhealthy behaviors, such as physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthful eating, remain highly prevalent, posing formidable challenges in efforts to improve cardiovascular health. While traditional interventions to promote healthy lifestyles are both costly and effective, wearable trackers, especially Fitbit devices, can provide a low-cost alternative that may effectively help large numbers of individuals become more physically fit and thereby maintain a good health status. Objective The objectives of this meta-analysis are (1) to assess the effectiveness of interventions that incorporate a Fitbit device for healthy lifestyle outcomes (eg, steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and weight) and (2) to identify which additional intervention components or study characteristics are the most effective at improving healthy lifestyle outcomes. Methods A systematic review was conducted, searching the following databases from 2007 to 2019: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL (Cochrane). Studies were included if (1) they were randomized controlled trials, (2) the intervention involved the use of a Fitbit device, and (3) the reported outcomes were related to healthy lifestyles. The main outcome measures were related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and weight. All the studies were assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the treatment effect of interventions that included a Fitbit device compared with a control group. We also conducted subgroup analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to further disentangle the effects of intervention components. Results Our final sample comprised 41 articles reporting the results of 37 studies. For Fitbit-based interventions, we found a statistically significant increase in daily step count (mean difference [MD] 950.54, 95% CI 475.89-1425.18; P&lt;.001) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MD 6.16, 95% CI 2.80-9.51; P&lt;.001), a significant decrease in weight (MD −1.48, 95% CI −2.81 to −0.14; P=.03), and a nonsignificant decrease in objectively assessed and self-reported sedentary behavior (MD −10.62, 95% CI −35.50 to 14.27; P=.40 and standardized MD −0.11, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.26; P=.56, respectively). In general, the included studies were at low risk for bias, except for performance bias. Subgroup analysis and fsQCA demonstrated that, in addition to the effects of the Fitbit devices, setting activity goals was the most important intervention component. Conclusions The use of Fitbit devices in interventions has the potential to promote healthy lifestyles in terms of physical activity and weight.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since its inception, the Information Systems discipline has been striving to develop impactful papers that contribute to cumulative knowledge development. Yet, there is a surprising lack of insights on how scientific impact can be accomplished and to which extent this impact represents a substantial engagement with, and extension of the knowledge contributions of the original papers. Especially for review articles and design science research, there are both competing conceptions of what makes these papers impactful and a lack of empirical evidence that would inform this debate. Furthermore, there is a latent skepticism as to whether this sometimes staggering impact of review articles actually represents knowledge development. In a similar way, it is unclear how and to which extent design science research has stimulated meaningful, cumulative knowledge development in information systems. The goal of this thesis is therefore to (1) explain and to (2) distinguish the scientific impact of review articles and design science research. Specifically, the first goal considers overall scientific impact as the dependent variable whose association with antecedent factors is analyzed by regression methodologies. The second goal zooms in on the concept of scientific impact and considers it as a relation between citing and cited papers that is explored through methodologies of manual content analysis and machine- learning classification.With Paper 1, I develop the foundation of knowledge development through review articles by crystallizing their contributions and aligning them with their underlying knowledge conver- sion processes in an overarching framework. This framework is based on the abstraction and codification of knowledge and thereby integrates two essential dimensions of knowledge devel- opment. Overall, the foundation developed in the first paper informs the underlying conception of knowledge development of both review articles and citing papers.Addressing the first goal, Papers 2 and 3 develop and test scientometric impact models ex- plaining the scientific impact of review articles and design science research, respectively. Beyond common control variables related to the journal and author level, they offer distinct insights for each type of paper. For review articles, I identify strong effects related to methodological transparency and the development of a research agenda, which vary depending on the type of review. For design science research, I show that theorization and novelty drive scientific impact.Concerning the second goal, Papers 4 and 5 distinguish different types of scientific impact of review articles and design science research, respectively. To analyze the different types of impact that review articles have on their overwhelming number of citing papers, I develop machine learning classifiers. Specifically, I distinguish ideational impact, which corresponds to a substantial engagement with and development of the knowledge contributions of the review article, from perfunctory impact, which corresponds to more trivial connections to the review article. In a similar, though not automated way, I analyze the types of impact of information systems design theories, a particular type of design science research. These analyses primarily focus on whether follow-up research tests and extends these theories. Based on our content analysis, I identify an alarming paucity of follow-up research in this area and develop specific guidelines for the design science community to address this challenge.The thesis concludes with an overview of the research contributions, implications for research practice, future research opportunities, and final remarks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWagner, G. a. =. {.

Yet, there is a surprising lack of insights on how scientific impact can be accomplished and to which extent this impact represents a substantial engagement with, and extension of the knowledge contributions of the original papers. Especially for review articles and design science research, there are both competing conceptions of what makes these papers impactful and a lack of empirical evidence that would inform this debate. Furthermore, there is a latent skepticism as to whether this sometimes staggering impact of review articles actually represents knowledge development. In a similar way, it is unclear how and to which extent design science research has stimulated meaningful, cumulative knowledge development in information systems. The goal of this thesis is therefore to (1) explain and to (2) distinguish the scientific impact of review articles and design science research. Specifically, the first goal considers overall scientific impact as the dependent variable whose association with antecedent factors is analyzed by regression methodologies. The second goal zooms in on the concept of scientific impact and considers it as a relation between citing and cited papers that is explored through methodologies of manual content analysis and machine- learning classification.&lt;br&gt;With Paper 1, I develop the foundation of knowledge development through review articles by crystallizing their contributions and aligning them with their underlying knowledge conver- sion processes in an overarching framework. This framework is based on the abstraction and codification of knowledge and thereby integrates two essential dimensions of knowledge devel- opment. Overall, the foundation developed in the first paper informs the underlying conception of knowledge development of both review articles and citing papers.&lt;br&gt;Addressing the first goal, Papers 2 and 3 develop and test scientometric impact models ex- plaining the scientific impact of review articles and design science research, respectively. Beyond common control variables related to the journal and author level, they offer distinct insights for each type of paper. For review articles, I identify strong effects related to methodological transparency and the development of a research agenda, which vary depending on the type of review. For design science research, I show that theorization and novelty drive scientific impact.&lt;br&gt;Concerning the second goal, Papers 4 and 5 distinguish different types of scientific impact of review articles and design science research, respectively. To analyze the different types of impact that review articles have on their overwhelming number of citing papers, I develop machine learning classifiers. Specifically, I distinguish ideational impact, which corresponds to a substantial engagement with and development of the knowledge contributions of the review article, from perfunctory impact, which corresponds to more trivial connections to the review article. In a similar, though not automated way, I analyze the types of impact of information systems design theories, a particular type of design science research. These analyses primarily focus on whether follow-up research tests and extends these theories.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Accessibility, continuity, and cost of care services present persistent challenges in today’s healthcare systems. Teleconsultation is considered an opportunity to address these challenges while maintaining quality of care. In this paper, we develop and empirically test an extended Expectation Confirmation Model via an online survey of Canadian users.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today, organizations must deal with a plethora of IT security threats and to ensure smooth and uninterrupted business operations, firms are challenged to predict the volume of IT security vulnerabilities and allocate resources for fixing them. This challenge requires decision makers to assess which system or software packages are prone to vulnerabilities, how many post-release vulnerabilities can be expected to occur during a certain period of time, and what impact exploits might have. Substantial research has been dedicated to techniques that analyze source code and detect security vulnerabilities. However, only limited research has focused on forecasting security vulnerabilities that are detected and reported after the release of software. To address this shortcoming, we apply established methodologies which are capable of forecasting events exhibiting specific time series characteristics of security vulnerabilities, i.e., rareness of occurrence, volatility, non-stationarity, and seasonality. Based on a dataset taken from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the forecasting accuracy of single, double, and triple exponential smoothing methodologies, Croston’s methodology, ARIMA, and a neural network-based approach. We analyze the impact of the applied forecasting methodology on the prediction accuracy with regard to its robustness along the dimensions of the examined system and software package “operating systems”, “browsers” and “office solutions” and the applied metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the effect of forecasting methodologies and to apply metrics that are suitable in this context. Our results show that the optimal forecasting methodology depends on the software or system package, as some methodologies perform poorly in the context of IT security vulnerabilities, that absolute metrics can cover the actual prediction error precisely, and that the prediction accuracy is robust within the two applied forecasting-error metrics.}, author+an:orcid = {;0000-0003-2682-8036;0000-0003-3926-7717;0000-0003-3794-1413\n\n\n  Article / DOI link \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYasasin, E., Prester, J., Wagner, G., & Schryen, G.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background The COVID-19 crisis has drastically changed care delivery with teleconsultation platforms experiencing substantial spikes in demand, helping patients and care providers avoid infections and maintain health care services. Beyond the current pandemic, teleconsultation is considered a significant opportunity to address persistent health system challenges, including accessibility, continuity, and cost of care, while ensuring quality. Objective This study aims at identifying the determinants of patients’ intention to continue using a teleconsultation platform. It extends prior research on information technology use continuance intention and teleconsultation services. Methods Data was collected in November 2018 and May 2019 with Canadian patients who had access to a teleconsultation platform. Measures included patients’ intention to continue their use; teleconsultation usefulness; teleconsultation quality; patients’ trust toward the digital platform, its provider. and health care professionals; and confirmation of patients’ expectations toward teleconsultation. We used structural equation modeling employing the partial least squares component-based technique to test our research model and hypotheses. Results We analyzed a sample of 178 participants who had used teleconsultation services. Our findings revealed that confirmation of expectations had the greatest influence on continuance intention (total effects=0.722; P&lt;.001), followed by usefulness (total effects=0.587; P&lt;.001) and quality (total effects=0.511; P&lt;.001). Usefulness (β=.60; P&lt;.001) and quality (β=.34; P=.01) had direct effects on the dependent variable. The confirmation of expectations had direct effects both on usefulness (β=.56; P&lt;.001) and quality (β=.75; P&lt;.001) in addition to having an indirect effect on usefulness (indirect effects=0.282; P&lt;.001). Last, quality directly influenced usefulness (β=.34; P=.002) and trust (β=.88; P&lt;.001). Trust does not play a role in the context under study. Conclusions Teleconsultation is central to care going forward, and it represents a significant lever for an improved, digital delivery of health care in the future.

The confirmation of expectations had direct effects both on usefulness (β=.56; P&lt;.001) and quality (β=.75; P&lt;.001) in addition to having an indirect effect on usefulness (indirect effects=0.282; P&lt;.001). Last, quality directly influenced usefulness (β=.34; P=.002) and trust (β=.88; P&lt;.001). Trust does not play a role in the context under study. Conclusions Teleconsultation is central to care going forward, and it represents a significant lever for an improved, digital delivery of health care in the future. We believe that our findings will help drive long-term teleconsultation adoption and use, including in the aftermath of the current COVID-19 crisis, so that general care improvement and greater preparedness for exceptional situations can be achieved.}, author+an:orcid               = {0000-0002-2947-0386;0000-0003-3926-7717;0000-0003-1631-8171;0000-0001-7425-1994}\n}"

    "text": "Although off‐the‐shelf enterprise systems (ES) have been widely adopted in organisations, the extant literature repeatedly documents ES failures caused by misfits between organisational processes and the ES. Although some misfits can be identified early in the ES lifecycle, others emerge in the onward and upward phase (i.e., after the implementation) and, hence, must be resolved reactively. Prior research on misfits and resolution strategies has primarily focused on the implementation phase, often assuming that close‐to‐perfect information on the misfit’s nature and characteristics is available. However, no study has examined how to effectively complete a shared diagnosis and resolution of misfits when diverging individual user perceptions are taken as the starting point. Such situations may be particularly pronounced in pluralistic organisations, where a variety of interdependent processes and potentially competing perceptions of processes are prevalent. The main objective of this study is to address this gap. To this end, we propose a pragmatic method for the diagnosis and resolution of misfits between organisational processes and enterprise systems, which builds on an actionable conceptualization of misfits. This method builds on theoretical concepts of affordances, affordance actualization, user participation, and change agentry. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted an action research study in a university hospital. Our analysis focused on a specific misfit involving the hospital’s ES‐supported clinical processes.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background Prospective physicians are expected to find artificial intelligence (AI) to be a key technology in their future practice. This transformative change has caught the attention of scientists, educators, and policy makers alike, with substantive efforts dedicated to the selection and delivery of AI topics and competencies in the medical curriculum. Less is known about the behavioral perspective or the necessary and sufficient preconditions for medical students’ intention to use AI in the first place. Objective Our study focused on medical students’ knowledge, experience, attitude, and beliefs related to AI and aimed to understand whether they are necessary conditions and form sufficient configurations of conditions associated with behavioral intentions to use AI in their future medical practice. Methods We administered a 2-staged questionnaire operationalizing the variables of interest (ie, knowledge, experience, attitude, and beliefs related to AI, as well as intention to use AI) and recorded 184 responses at t0 (February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 138 responses at t1 (January 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic). Following established guidelines, we applied necessary condition analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to analyze the data. Results Findings from the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis show that the intention to use AI is only observed when students have a strong belief in the role of AI (individually necessary condition); certain AI profiles, that is, combinations of knowledge and experience, attitudes and beliefs, and academic level and gender, are always associated with high intentions to use AI (equifinal and sufficient configurations); and profiles associated with nonhigh intentions cannot be inferred from profiles associated with high intentions (causal asymmetry). Conclusions Our work contributes to prior knowledge by showing that a strong belief in the role of AI in the future of medical professions is a necessary condition for behavioral intentions to use AI. Moreover, we suggest that the preparation of medical students should go beyond teaching AI competencies and that educators need to account for the different AI profiles associated with high or nonhigh intentions to adopt AI.\n\n\n  Article / DOI link    Open access PDF \n\n\n\n\nAppendix / supplementary materials: &lt;https://github.com/digital-work-lab/fsQCA-physicians-intention-to-use-AI}, author+an:orcid = {0000-0003-3926-7717;0000-0003-1631-8171;0000-0001-7425-1994&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

This can be useful to track the mapping between version numbers and the corresponding hash-id (git history).\nWhen receiving feedback in the docx: always make sure that feedback (including tracked and untracked changes) is transferred to the paper manually.\n\nCreate PDF from word with tracked changes (it is important to know which ones have/have not been addressed rather than having a Word-file in which all changes have been accepted/issues addressed - this is done in the paper.md.).\nWhile addressing the comments: highlight suggestions that have been addressed in green (strike out suggestions that will not be addressed), and possibly provide comments on how issues have been addressed (why this way?).\nTypos and very minor comments: address in one commit (e.g., “fix spelling errors”)\nOther comments: address in individual commits (possibly including the comment-ids generated by the word-to-pdf export in the commit message)\nMajor issues: include in the readme.md (possibly discuss with coauthors) and address in a separate branch",

Unlike traditional deduplication methods, BibDedupe focuses on entity resolution, linking duplicate records instead of simply deleting them.\n\nAutomated Duplicate Linking with Zero False Positives: BibDedupe automates the duplicate linking process with a focus on eliminating false positives.\nPreprocessing Approach: BibDedupe uses a preprocessing approach that reflects the unique error generation process in academic databases, such as author re-formatting, journal abbreviation or translations.\nEntity Resolution: BibDedupe does not simply delete duplicates, but it links duplicates to resolve the entity and integrates the data. This allows for validation, and undo operations.\nProgrammatic Access: BibDedupe is designed for seamless integration into existing research workflows, providing programmatic access for easy incorporation into scripts and applications.\nTransparent and Reproducible Rules: BibDedupe’s blocking and matching rules are transparent and easily reproducible to promote reproducibility in deduplication processes.\nContinuous Benchmarking: Continuous integration tests running on GitHub Actions ensure ongoing benchmarking, maintaining the library’s reliability and performance across datasets.\nEfficient and Parallel Computation: BibDedupe implements computations efficiently and in parallel, using appropriate data structures and functions for optimal performance.",

The following steps describe how to:\n\nSet up the repository (create a new one or contribute to an existing one),\nEdit the paper, and\nBuild the paper.\n\nThe paper template creates the following files (additional files for the analysis can be added):\n├── README.md     &lt;- README containing summaries of the paper's revisions (completed\n│                    and ongoing).

This can be accomplished by using the code in comments at the beginning of the Makefile.\n\nStep 1: Set up the repository\nStart your manuscript development by using the Quarto template. This template provides a structured format for your initial drafts, helping to organize content efficiently.\nOption 1: Create a new repository\n\nSelect a short and pronounceable title for the paper.\nDo not refer to papers by their target journal (e.g., “the Journal of Information Technology paper”).\nUse our Quarto template:\n\ngit init\nquarto use template fs-ise/quarto-template-paper\n# change title etc.\n# git add . \n# git commit ...\n# etc.\n# git remote add origin https://github.com/....\n# git branch -M main\n# git push -u origin main\nquarto preview\nOption 2: Contribute to an existing repository\n# pull repository\ngit clone git@github.com:fs-ise/...\npre-commit install\n\n\nStep 2: Edit the paper\nThe paper.qmd is written in Markdown. There are three ways to edit a paper:\n\nGitHub edit\n\nDoes not support DOCX/TeX/PDF generation.\nDoes not support commits changing multiple files.\nRequires an Internet connection.\nNo setup required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteShort illustration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodespace edit\n\nSupports DOCX/TeX/PDF generation.\nSupports all types of commits.\nRequires an Internet connection.\nNo setup required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteShort illustration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal edit\n\nSupports DOCX/TeX/PDF generation.\nSupports all types of commits.\nDoes not require an Internet connection.\nRequires some setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteShort illustration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Build the paper\nquarto preview\n# MANUALLY select a citation style by updating the link at the beginning of the Makefile\n# MANUALLY select templates for DOCX/TeX/PDF by updating the link at the beginning of the Makefile\n\nCitation styles can be selected here.\nTemplates are available here.\nSee Pandoc journal templates.",

There are two main reasons why we cite: firstly, to respect copyrighted works, and secondly, to adhere to the principles of good scientific practice by appropriately acknowledging the contributions of others. The following examples use Markdown syntax (used by Pandoc converters and Quarto).\nThe syntax is based on the citation syntax (see CSL). Further information on the citation syntax is available in the Pandoc manual.\nTo include citations:\n\nAdd them to the references.\nCite them in the text, and\nGenerate the bibliography.\n\n\nReferences (BibTeX file)\nThe bibliography is stored as a BibTeX file (typically references.bib) and versioned by Git.\n\nChanges in the BibTeX file should be checked before committing.\nReferences should be as complete as possible, including the relevant fields.\nEach reference should be listed once (not multiple times).\nExamples with relevant fields are summarized below.\nJournal articles\n\n@article{LeeAnderson2001,\n    doi                = {10.1006/COGP.2000.0747},\n    author             = {Anderson, John R},\n    journal            = {Cognitive Psychology},\n    title              = {Does learning a complex task},\n    year               = {2001},\n    volume             = {42},\n    number             = {3},\n    pages              = {267--316},\n}\n\nConference papers\n\n@inproceedings{LeeAnderson2001,\n    author             = {Weber, Matthias and Remus, Ulrich and Pregenzer, Michael},\n    booktitle          = {Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Systems},\n    title              = {A new era of control: Understanding algorithmic control in the gig economy},\n    year               = {2022},\n}\n\nBooks:\n\n@book{Kolb2014,\n    author             = {Kolb, David A},\n    title              = {Experiential learning},\n    year               = {2014},\n    publisher          = {FT Press},\n}\n\nEssays in collected editions:\n\n@incollection{Anderson1984a,\n    author             = {Anderson, Richard C},\n    booktitle          = {Theoretical models},\n    title              = {Role of the reader's schema in comprehension, learning, and memory},\n    year               = {2018},\n    pages              = {136--145},\n    publisher          = {Routledge},\n}\n\nWebsites\n\n@online{Microsoft2018,\n    author             = {Microsoft News Center},\n    title              = {Microsoft to acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion},\n    year               = {2018},\n    url                = {https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/},\n}\n\n\nIn-text citations\nIn-text citations can be parenthetical or narrative (see APA style). Word-for-word quotations (parenthetical or narrative) must be identified by quotation marks, and a page number must be given. Parenthetical citations tend to be preferred over narrative citations because they put more emphasis on the content, concepts, or findings instead of the authors.\nThe following example illustrates the citation syntax of Markdown (or the Pandoc converters used by Quarto) (link). The unique IDs (e.g., SmithEtAl2006) are used to link citations to the corresponding elements in the BibTeX file.\n&lt;!-- Example *parenthetical* citation: --&gt;\n\nFitness trackers were found to have mixed effects on sedentary behavior [@SmithEtAl2006].\n\n&lt;!-- Example *narrative* citation: --&gt;\n\n@SmithEtAl2006 analyzed the effectiveness of fitness trackers.\n\n&lt;!-- Example *word-for-word quotation*: --&gt;\n\nFor fitness trackers, \"measures of sleep quality are inaccurate\" [@SmithEtAl2006, p. 111].\nWhen rendered with Quarto and the APA citation style, this will be displayed as:\n\nFitness trackers were found to have mixed effects on sedentary behavior (Smith et al. 2006).\nSmith et al. (2006) analyzed the effectiveness of fitness trackers.\nFor fitness trackers, “measures of sleep quality are inaccurate” (Smith et al. 2006, p. 111).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFormatting guidelines\n\n\n\nFields\n\nENTRYTYPE set correctly (e.g., “article” or “inproceedings”).\nauthor formatted correctly (Wagner, G. and Prester, J.).\ntitle complete and in sentence case (e.g., “On the origin of species,” not “On the Origin of Species”).\njournal field complete and in title case (e.g., “Journal of Information Technology,” not “JIT”).\nvolume, number, pages, doi fields added.\n\nTo update references based on Crossref, the colrev-sync package can be used:\ncolrev-sync sync\nNotes\n\nGroups of in-text citations should be sorted alphabetically (especially if a prefix is used), i.e., use [e.g., @Bacharach1989; @Gregor2006a] instead of [e.g., @Gregor2006a; @Bacharach1989].\nAdd {} to protect cases when necessary (e.g., {J}ab{R}ef) because CSL styles that require title case will use an automatic title-case conversion (1).\nTo cite software, datasets, and other artifacts, CiteAs is useful.\nJournal fields: Some CSL styles require abbreviations. Temporarily replace the journal field in the BibTeX file since CSL does not handle style-specific journal abbreviations (1). JSON files containing journal abbreviations can be passed to Pandoc using the citation-abbreviations field.\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\nIn a Markdown document, the bibliography (also known as the references section) is created automatically based on the BibTeX file and CSL specified in the YAML header. The nocite field can be used to add references that are cited in figures/tables but not in the text.\n---\ntitle: \"Writing\"\nbibliography: path_to_/references.bib\ncsl: path_to/apa.csl\nnocite: |\n  @Davis1989\n  @LangePfarrer2017\n  @StrunkWhite1999\n  @WebsterWatson2002\n---\n\n... text with citations\n\n# References\n\n&lt;!-- References will be generated in the specified CSL style after this heading. --&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWord/Zotero\n\n\n\n\n\nFor DOCX formats, use a reference manager plugin (such as Zotero). The reference manager should support the standardized citation styles of CSL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConceptual illustrations and plots\nFor conceptual illustrations, PowerPoint is currently recommended.\n\nEnsure alignment, etc.\nFor PDF submissions, extract it as PDF (vector graphic with embedded text).\nFor Word submissions, extract it as EMF (vector graphic with embedded text).\n\nTo plot findings, the R package ggplot2 is recommended. ggplot2 is a powerful library and allows us to automatically update the figures when the findings change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is possible to edit ggplot2 plots with LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteQuarto extensions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks: Bookdown project.\nPossible extensions (Lua filters): bibexport, abstract-to-meta, spellcheck, wordcount.\n\nhttps://github.com/kapsner/authors-block https://github.com/jmgirard/embedpdf https://github.com/andrewheiss/quarto-wordcount",

It uses the handbook’s RAG index to determine which documents exist and only retrieves data from valid entries listed there. \n\nWhen users ask about handbook topics such as procedures, team, research, or teaching, the assistant looks up the RAG index to find the most relevant JSON or Markdown files and fetches the corresponding content through the appropriate `raw_url` or `get_section_rag` calls. It must not send requests to arbitrary paths or inferred URLs; it only queries those explicitly listed in the RAG index. If a requested document is missing, leads to a 404 error, or is not present in the index, the assistant informs the user clearly and suggests checking or updating the handbook structure.\n\nResponses must always reflect actual content retrieved from the valid source file. When a section contains multiple related documents (for example, several process files under `10-lab/10_processes/`), the assistant selects and summarizes the relevant files based on their titles and topics, and it can suggest related entries for context. If there are ambiguities, it asks clarifying questions to determine which indexed document(s) to reference.\n\nThe assistant’s tone remains respectful, mentoring, and collaborative. It supports users in interpreting procedures, understanding lab practices, and improving the handbook by suggesting edits or additions when inconsistencies or missing information arise. It always prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and contextual insight when guiding users through the Digital Work Lab handbook."

    "section": "Structure and contents",
    "text": "Structure and contents\nThe default structure outlined below may need to be adapted to the thesis or paper at hand. Each section has its own scope, as illustrated in the figure below. It is recommended to use active voice (“I” or “We”) instead of passive voice (commonly used in German).\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a research paper\n\n\nAbstract\nThe abstract serves as a point of entry for the reader, providing an overview of the research study, including the motivation for the study, the methodological approach taken, and a summary of the main results. Additionally, the purpose of the research study should be clearly defined. Typically, an abstract consists of around 200 words.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction should clearly outline the purpose of the study as well as the research question that is being addressed. By briefly outlining the context of the study in terms of content and time, the reader gains a quick overview. A key aspect of the introduction is the presentation of the motivation for conducting the study, which provides the reader with a basic understanding of the topic and underscores the relevance and importance of the study. The relevance and purpose can be further highlighted by using an appropriate quotation.\nThe building blocks of Lange & Pfarrer (2017) may be helpful:\n\nCommon ground: Establishing common ground involves presenting the current state of the literature and ensuring that the reader agrees with the basic assumptions, boundary conditions, and key concepts. This step is crucial for gaining the reader’s interest and tacit consent, making them more receptive to the forthcoming arguments and discussions.\nComplication: After establishing common ground, introduce a complication that challenges the current understanding or highlights a gap in the literature. This complication could be a problem, puzzle, or twist that makes the reader realize the inadequacy or incompleteness of the existing academic conversation.\nConcern: To make the complication compelling, explain why it matters. This involves demonstrating the significance of the gap or issue identified. The concern step is about showing the practical and theoretical implications of the complication, emphasizing why it is essential to address this gap in the literature.\nCourse of action: Describe the approach or methodology that will be used to address the identified complication. This could involve developing new constructs, modeling relationships, exploring processes, or synthesizing existing theories. The course of action should be clearly explained, logically structured, and directly aimed at resolving the complication.\nContribution: Finally, articulate how the research will contribute to the academic conversation. This entails explaining the novelty and significance of the findings and how they advance understanding in the field. The contribution should also suggest future theoretical exploration and practical implications for management and organizations.\n\nThe final paragraph of the introduction provides an outline of the structure of the study, briefly describing the approaches taken in each step of conducting the research study. This gives the reader a clear picture of the composition of the study, indicating what can and cannot be expected.\nBackground\nThis section (which could also be named Literature Review or Conceptual Framework) sets the theoretical and conceptual context of the study and grounds the leading assumptions in theories. This is done by outlining and citing pertinent work. Here, the author can present the acquired background knowledge that is relevant for the following sections of the study. This background knowledge also helps in building the conceptual framework of the study.\nThe literature review should focus on concepts rather than authors and historical development (cf. Webster & Watson, 2002). It is also possible to use a conceptual framework to structure the literature synthesis. Provide precise definitions of those concepts that are central to your work, emphasize concepts rather than authors, and avoid including your own judgment in the background section. Use established definitions and concepts and provide a justification when adapting them.\nA graphical representation of the framework helps to illustrate complex theoretical constructs as well as the boundaries of the research study. The explicit statement of the conceptual framework not only informs the reader but also guides the author in conducting the research.\nRelevant background literature can be found in journals such as those listed in: - the AIS Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals - the VHB Jourqual Ranking - or conferences such as ICIS and ECIS.\nPapers can be accessed through the Bamberger Katalog, a search on ResearchGate, a search on Google, or by contacting the authors (see outlets for more information).\nGuidelines on searching the literature are provided by Webster & Watson (2002).\nMethodology\nThe methodology section describes a systematic and goal-oriented approach to answering the research question. Therefore, the selection of the research method needs to be consistent with the research questions. The approach may be, for example, empirical, analytical, comparative, systematic, historical, or hermeneutic. The methodological approach needs to be described in detail; appropriate reporting standards for the research method should be considered (such as PRISMA for literature reviews); it should be possible to understand the methodological procedures based on the thesis. For example, it is necessary to provide the formulas of regression models.\nResults\nIn this section, the author presents the results of the study. If they are presented through figures and/or tables, the results should be clearly legible. Furthermore, in the case of figures, it is recommended to use vector graphics, as this ensures good readability without the need to pre-specify the font size within the figures. An example figure and table can be found in the template contained in this repository.\nDiscussion\nIn this section, the author provides a discussion of the results and is thus able to draw an informed conclusion. More precisely, the discussion is an evaluative summary of the research study in relation to the research question. In general, the discussion can be divided into three parts. First, the results should be tied to the research question, thus presenting the reader with a solution or improvement to the identified problem space. Here, for example, the author can draw on empirical findings introduced in the Results section to support their argument. Next, the author should outline the limitations of the research study by critically examining the research approach used. Limitations might include, for example, a limited time frame considered in the research study or the individual refinement of a specific research method due to time constraints. Finally, suggestions for future research avenues should be provided. These suggestions may align with the limitations, allowing other researchers to build on the present work by extending or analyzing it. In summary, the Discussion section presents the results in relation to the research question, as well as the restrictions of the study and suggestions for future research in the respective domain.\nConclusion\nThe conclusion contains a summary of the research study. In contrast to the Discussion section, in which the main results are presented, here the key contributions of the work are showcased. A well-crafted conclusion answers the research question stated in the Introduction. By doing so, the author clarifies to what extent the research study has presented a solution or improvement to the examined problem space.\nDeclarations\nThis section may contain an “Availability of data, materials, and code” statement (e.g., linking to a GitHub repository or a digital appendix) and acknowledgements.",

    "text": "Style\nThe style guide of Strunk & White (1999) summarizes many instructive recommendations.\n\nWriting concisely\nWrite as concisely as possible, avoiding general statements, such as:\n\n“There is a research gap.” - State what the gap is specifically and why it is important to address it.\n“Current knowledge is insufficient.” - State for what purpose current knowledge is insufficient.\n\n\n\nTense\nPresent tense\n\nUse for general truths, facts, and accepted knowledge\n(e.g., “Water boils at 100°C”).\nDescribe what the paper does or contains\n(e.g., “This study investigates…” or “The results indicate…”).\nRefer to figures, tables, or conclusions in the paper\n(e.g., “Figure 1 shows…”).\n\nPast tense\n\nDescribe specific methods or experiments conducted\n(e.g., “We analyzed the data using SPSS”).\nReport specific results or findings from the study\n(e.g., “The analysis revealed a significant correlation”).\nRefer to prior research\n(e.g., “Smith et al. (2020) found…”).\n\n\n\nTopic sentences\nTo write clearly, it is helpful to focus on topic sentences (the first sentence of each paragraph, which gives a clear outline of what is covered in the paragraph). Good examples of topic sentences can be found in top-tier journal papers like the one by Davis (1989):\n\nPerceived usefulness and perceived ease of use\nWhat causes people to accept or reject information technology? Among the many variables that may influence system use, previous research suggests two determinants that are especially important. First, people tend to use or not use an application to the extent they believe it will help them perform their job better. We refer to this first variable as perceived usefulness. Second, even if potential users believe that a given application is useful, they may, at the same time, believe that the system is too hard to use and that the performance benefits of usage are outweighed by the effort of using the application. That is, in addition to usefulness, usage is theorized to be influenced by perceived ease of use.\nPerceived usefulness is defined here as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance.” This follows from the definition of the word useful: “capable of being used advantageously.” Within an organizational context, people are generally reinforced for good performance by raises, promotions, bonuses, and other rewards (Pfeffer, 1982; Schein, 1980; Vroom, 1964). A system high in perceived usefulness, in turn, is one for which a user believes in the existence of a positive use-performance relationship.\nPerceived ease of use, in contrast, refers to “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort.” This follows from the definition of “ease”: “freedom from difficulty or great effort.” Effort is a finite resource that a person may allocate to the various activities for which he or she is responsible (Radner and Rothschild, 1975). All else being equal, we claim, an application perceived to be easier to use than another is more likely to be accepted by users.\n\n\n\nConcept-centric style\nEspecially in related work sections, it can be tempting to summarize one study after another. This author-centric style can be hard to read because it often fails to explain how the concepts and findings of studies are related. A concept-centric style can be more effective for organizing prior research.\n\nExample of an author-centric style\nAuthor A (2001) has studied the acceptance of group support systems and found positive effects on group performance. Author B (2002) has studied expert systems at IBM and found mixed effects on organizational performance. Author C (2003) has surveyed executives and documented diverging views on the benefits of decision support systems.\nExample of a concept-centric style\nPrior research has examined the effect of decision support systems on various outcomes. There are multiple studies reporting consistent and positive effects on organizational performance (Author A 2001, Author B 2002). In contrast, effects on individual performance were mixed. Studies that measured performance objectively tended to report positive effects (Author C 2020, Author D 2021), while studies of perceived performance did not report significant effects (Author E 2005, Author D 2006).\n\nWebster & Watson (2002) provides advice on constructing a concept matrix.",

    "text": "Cover letter\nExample 1: JOSS\nDear JOSS editors,\nI am pleased to submit the Python package BibDedupe for consideration and possible publication in the Journal of Open-Source Software. This submission addresses the clear need for effective software tailored to the detection of duplicates within bibliographic data.\nIn academic research, especially in areas involving meta-analysis and research synthesis, the accurate identification of duplicate bibliographic entries is essential. These duplicates, often resulting from the dissemination of a single study across multiple databases, can affect the integrity of research outcomes. Existing tools for deduplication generally do not cater adequately to the unique aspects of bibliographic data, which has very specific and idiosyncratic variations in authors’ names, publication titles, and source details. BibDedupe is designed to address these specific challenges, focusing on achieving zero false positives to ensure that each unique study is correctly represented in research summaries.\nOur development is informed by a comprehensive understanding of bibliographic data management and data quality requirements. It employs a detailed approach to data preprocessing, blocking, matching, and merging, offering efficiency and reproducibility in deduplicating bibliographic records. The performance of the package is particularly beneficial for researchers engaged in literature reviews involving large volumes of publications.\nBibDedupe is one of the first open-source tools in its domain that actively seeks peer review of its code. The field of literature review and meta-analysis software has long been dominated by proprietary and non-peer-reviewed tools, leading to a gap in the availability of rigorously evaluated, open-source options. By submitting BibDedupe to JOSS, we aim to raise standards in the field, encouraging the development of more rigorous, effective, and transparent tools for conducting literature reviews and meta-analyses. This effort aligns with a growing demand in the academic community for open-source tools that are not only functional but also validated through peer review.\nI believe BibDedupe will be a valuable contribution to the Journal of Open-Source Software, appealing to researchers looking for efficient and reliable bibliographic data management tools. I look forward to sharing more details in a paper to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\nBest regards,\nGerit Wagner",

    "text": "The digitalization of knowledge work is reshaping how tasks are performed across various industries, with significant implications for individual workers and organizations. This transformation is driven by the adoption of digital work practices, distributed organizing models, AI capabilities, and advancements in knowledge synthesis. These shifts are creating new opportunities and challenges for knowledge workers, as traditional practices are reconfigured by emerging technologies.\nOur focus is on understanding these shifts at the intersection of digital work, distributed organizing, and knowledge synthesis, identifying effective practices, and designing tools to meet the evolving demands of knowledge workers.\nOur work builds on literature review methods, design science research, and empirical research. We work on projects in collaboration with researchers from institutions like HEC Montréal, Sydney University, the University of Virginia, Bamberg University, and Dortmund University. These joint efforts enable us to combine expertise across disciplines and leverage synergies between different research streams, allowing us to tackle both practical applications and foundational questions. This integrated approach helps us address key challenges in digital knowledge work while driving advancements that benefit both academic research and industry practices.\n\n1. Digital work practices\nThis research stream explores the evolving role of individual knowledge workers, such as physicians, data scientists, developers, and innovative thinkers, whose work is characterized by agility, innovation, and emergent practices driven by experience and expertise rather than formalized procedures. It focuses on how digital technologies, particularly AI, are reconfiguring these work practices. Key areas of inquiry include the adoption of AI in professional settings, the interaction between AI and evidence-based practices, and how expert knowledge can be leveraged to adapt and improve enterprise systems. At the core, the goal of this research stream is to understand how knowledge work practices are reconfigured by digital technology and to provide actionable insights for leaders in knowledge-intensive fields, enabling them to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the digitalization of work, optimize the integration of new technologies, and enhance the effectiveness of digital work environments.\nExemplary research questions\n\nAdoption of AI What are the AI profiles of prospective physicians associated with a strong intention to use AIHT in their future medical practice?\nInteraction of AI with traditional evidence-based practices Do new AI capabilities reduce or reinforce evidence-based practices?\nLeveraging expertise to adapt enterprise systems How can the expertise of clinical experts be used to resolve misfits in enterprise systems?\n\nSelected publications: Wagner et al. (2023), Morquin et al. (2023), Paré et al. (2023), Wagner et al. (2025).\n\n\n2. Organizing distributed work\nThis research stream investigates how traditional organizational hierarchies—characterized by strict control and large, monolithic structures—are evolving alongside new, more flexible forms of work organization. These include distributed (Git-based) knowledge work, open-source communities, online labor markets, and open strategy initiatives such as open employee handbooks in all-remote organizations. These models are widely used in large tech companies, knowledge-intensive industries, and academia. The primary goal is to understand how distributed work practices can be organized effectively and how to manage these work arrangements for maximum productivity. This includes informing stakeholders about best practices for integrating these models with existing organizational frameworks.\nExemplary research questions\n\nProcesses of knowledge-intensive crowd work How can online marketplaces for knowledge-intensive service work be distinguished? How can the micro-and macro-level processes be organized?\nEffective sourcing of knowledge work in online labor markets What explains the successful sourcing of knowledge work from online labor markets at the level of individual workers and projects?\n\nSelected publications: Wagner, Prester, & Paré (2021), Wagner & Prester (2021), Wagner & Prester (2019).\n\n\n3. Knowledge synthesis\nThis research stream addresses the critical need for more efficient and effective knowledge synthesis in response to the vast and rapidly growing body of research. While the volume of available knowledge continues to increase, methods for synthesizing this research—particularly in the context of open and reproducible literature reviews—are falling behind. Key areas needing improvement include search query construction, validation, knowledge record matching, emergent concept analyses, and enhancing transparency and validation through AI and generative AI (GenAI) tools. These challenges are crucial across many fields, particularly for professions like medicine, where synthesizing the best available evidence is essential. At the core, the goal of this research stream is to design tools that make knowledge synthesis processes more efficient, transparent, and reliable, benefiting practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and students who navigate both academic and industry perspectives.\nExemplary research questions\n\nAI/LLM-supported literature reviews How can AI and LLM capabilities support the individual steps of the literature review process?\nUnderstanding quality and impact of review papers What makes a literature review successful in terms of scientific impact?\nDesign of open and reproducible research synthesis platforms How can tools make literature reviews and knowledge synthesis more efficient, transparent, and reliable?\n\nSelected publications: Wagner (2024), Wagner et al. (2022), Wagner, Prester, Roche, et al. (2021), Wagner & Prester (2025).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMorquin, D., Ologeanu‐Taddei, R., Paré, G., & Wagner, G. (2023).

Research on this emergent phenomenon has recently gained traction in terms of publication volume and research diversity. Focusing on the contributions of information systems research, we conducted a literature review to distinguish papers on DPKW from related types of digital platforms, to synthesize what we know about knowledge work on DPKW, and to guide future research. Based on a comprehensive literature search, we derived five boundary conditions, which constitute our definition of DPKW: digitality, value network paradigm, centralized governance, contractual work, and knowledge work. We further developed a conceptual process framework of the constituent processes of DPKW. With this framework, we elaborate on an established process model to distinguish the three macro­level processes of matching, contracting, and executing. We further examined micro­level processes suggested in extant research based on a process linking approach in order to understand how they synchronically instantiate each macro­level process. Emphasizing the significance of the micro­ and macro­level processes and the emergent stage of the literature on DPKW, we offer an agenda for future research and outline implications for practice.}, author+an:orcid = {0000-0003-3926-7717;0000-0003-2682-8036;0000-0001-7425-1994\n\n\n  Article / DOI link    Author copy \n\n\n\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

Based on a comprehensive literature search, we derived five boundary conditions, which constitute our definition of DPKW: digitality, value network paradigm, centralized governance, contractual work, and knowledge work. We further developed a conceptual process framework of the constituent processes of DPKW. With this framework, we elaborate on an established process model to distinguish the three macro­level processes of matching, contracting, and executing. We further examined micro­level processes suggested in extant research based on a process linking approach in order to understand how they synchronically instantiate each macro­level process. Emphasizing the significance of the micro­ and macro­level processes and the emergent stage of the literature on DPKW, we offer an agenda for future research and outline implications for practice.}, author+an:orcid               = {0000-0003-3926-7717;0000-0003-2682-8036;0000-0001-7425-1994}\n}\n\n\n\nTY  - JOUR\nAU  - Wagner, Gerit\nAU  - Prester, Julian\nAU  - Paré, Guy\nTI  - Exploring the boundaries and processes of digital platforms for knowledge work: A review of information systems research\nT2  - The Journal of Strategic Information Systems\nPY  - 2021\nVL  - 30\nIS  - 4\nSP  - 101694\nDO  - 10.1016/J.JSIS.2021.101694\nUR  - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096386872100041X\nER  -"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background Centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) is underused due to low referral rates, accessibility barriers, and socioeconomic constraints. mHealth technologies have the potential to address some of these challenges through remote delivery of home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR). This study aims to assess the effects of mHealth HBCR interventions compared with usual care and CBCR in patients with heart disease. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of mHealth HBCR interventions. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched from inception to March 31, 2023, with no restrictions on language or publication type. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of adult patients (age ≥18 years) with heart disease, comparing mHealth interventions with usual care or CBCR. The primary outcome of interest was aerobic exercise capacity, assessed with VO2 peak or 6-min walk test (6MWT). Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024544087. Findings Our search yielded 9164 references, of which 135 were retained for full-text review. 13 randomised controlled trials met eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review, involving 1508 adults with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or heart failure, or who had undergone revascularisation. Intervention duration ranged from 6 weeks to 24 weeks. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that, compared with usual care, mHealth HBCR significantly improved 6MWT (mean difference 24·74, 95% CI 9·88–39·60; 532 patients) and VO2 peak (1·77, 1·19–2·35; 359 patients). No significant differences were found between mHealth HBCR and CBCR. Quality of evidence ranged from low to very low across outcomes due to risk of bias and imprecision (small sample size). Interpretation mHealth HBCR could improve access and health outcomes in patients who are unable to attend CBCR. Further research is needed to build a robust evidence base on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mHealth HBCR, particularly in comparison with CBCR, to inform clinical practice and policy.\n\n\n  Article / DOI link    Open access PDF \n\n\n\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

While ongoing debates address the relative importance of design science contributions in the information systems community, insights into the scientific impact of design science research (DSR) are missing and this lack of understanding arguably poses challenges to an informed discourse. To identify the most influential papers and those factors that explain their scientific impact, this paper presents an exploratory study of the scientific impact of DSR papers published in the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket of Journals. We uncover the current DSR landscape by taking stock of influential papers and theories and develop a model to explain the scientific impact of DSR papers. Our findings show that scientific impact is significantly explained by theorization and novelty. We discuss how the implications of our work can be projected on the overarching discourse on DSR.}, author+an:orcid               = {0000-0003-3926-7717;0000-0003-2682-8036;0000-0003-3794-1413}\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background The practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has become pivotal in enhancing medical care and patient outcomes. With the diffusion of innovation in healthcare organizations, EBM can be expected to depend on medical professionals’ competences with digital health (dHealth) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Objective We aim to investigate the effect of dHealth competences and perceptions of AI on the adoption of EBM among prospective physicians. By focusing on dHealth and AI technologies, the study seeks to inform the redesign of medical curricula to better prepare students for the demands of evidence-based medical practice. Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered online to students at the University of Montreal’s medical school, which has approximately 1,400 enrolled students. The survey included questions on students’ dHealth competences, perceptions of AI, and their practice of EBM. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we analyzed data from 177 respondents to test our research model. Results Our analysis indicates that medical students possess foundational knowledge competences of dHealth technologies and perceive AI to play an important role in the future of medicine. Yet, their experiential competences with dHealth technologies are limited. Our findings reveal that experiential dHealth competences are significantly related to the practice of EBM (β = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001), as well as students’ perceptions of the role of AI in the future of medicine (β = 0.39, p &lt; 0.001), which, in turn, also affect EBM (β = 0.19, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The study underscores the necessity of enhancing students’ competences related to dHealth and considering their perceptions of the role of AI in the medical profession. In particular, the low levels of experiential dHealth competences highlight a promising starting point for training future physicians while simultaneously strengthening their practice of EBM. Accordingly, we suggest revising medical curricula to focus on providing students with practical experiences with dHealth and AI technologies.}, author+an:orcid = {0000-0003-3926-7717;0000-0002-6397-5660;0000-0003-1631-8171;0000-0001-7425-1994\n\n\n  Article / DOI link    Open access PDF \n\n\n\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

It is defined in stark contrast to total citation impact, a measure predominantly used in research evaluation that assumes that all citations are equal. Understanding ideational impact is critical for evaluating research impact and understanding how scientific disciplines build a cumulative tradition. Research has only recently developed automated citation classification techniques to distinguish between different types of citations and generally does not emphasize the conceptual content of the citations and its ideational impact.

    "section": "Pedagogical approach",
    "text": "Pedagogical approach\nOur pedagogical approach consists of four pillars: Active engagement, transparent assessment, DEI, and continuous reflection. These apply universally to all teaching formats.\nActive engagement is integral to our teaching efforts. Our passion for the subject matter plays a pivotal role in motivating students to get involved in the topic, challenge themselves, and grow. To foster this engagement, we employ a variety of teaching formats that encourage exploration, collaboration, and competition. We focus on guiding students through the learning process by asking insightful questions and offering support, all while preserving the inherent complexity of the material. This ensures that students develop resilience and sharpen their problem-solving abilities. In addition, we “dogfood” the work practices, tools, and theory covered in our sessions by implementing strategies such as Getting-Things-Done, organizing our work through a public handbook, and using cutting-edge knowledge management systems. Additionally, we integrate our research into our teaching, bringing real-world examples to the classroom and enriching the learning experience. \nTransparent assessment is the guiding principle for our teaching activities, and we strive to ensure that assessment is transparent, fair, and objective. We establish clear criteria and objectives at the outset of each course and session, which are made accessible through detailed documentation in our slides and learning materials. These criteria are directly tied to verifiable skills and learning outcomes, enabling students to understand exactly what is expected of them. To ensure objectivity, we implement consistent grading processes that evaluate students’ work based on these pre-defined criteria. Additionally, we recognize that some students may face disadvantages, whether due to personal circumstances or learning differences, and we offer tailored support to ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. This includes providing additional guidance, offering flexible deadlines when appropriate, and making accommodations for those with specific needs. Through these efforts, we aim to create a fair and supportive evaluation process that empowers all students to reach their full potential.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion are central to our learning environments. We believe that diversity in backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences is a strength in itself that also drives creativity, critical thinking, and innovation. Our teaching is grounded in the conviction that inclusive learning environments not only remove barriers but actively benefit from the plurality of voices and lived experiences our students bring. We strive to create spaces where all students feel valued, heard, and empowered to contribute — regardless of their identities, abilities, or prior experiences. Our goal is to create a space where students are not afraid to experiment and explore new ideas, contributing to a more dynamic and diverse educational experience that mirrors the inclusive and collaborative environments they will encounter in their future careers.\nContinuous reflection is at the core of our teaching approach. We adopt an iterative process where feedback from students and peer-reviewed teaching materials drive the evolution of our course content. By regularly revising the material, we ensure that it is up-to-date with recent evidence-based practices, peer-reviewed academic materials, and the latest industry trends. We constantly challenge ourselves to teach new topics, such as the new lecture Introduction to Digital Work, and to teach existing topics more effectively, for instance through our pedagogical recommendations for teaching Git. In addition, we develop teaching materials in openly accessible repositories and under open content licenses. Each repository, along with learning resources, such as slides and notebooks, provides students the opportunity to suggest changes and offer feedback through the open-source workflows of GitHub. This collaborative approach fosters an open and fully digital learning environment where students can actively contribute and adapt the course contents.",

    "text": "Focal areas\nOur teaching focuses on key areas that reflect the transformation of work in the digital age. These focal points equip students to understand and shape emerging forms of organizing, collaboration, and innovation in digital environments.\n\nThe digital transformation of work is a key area that focuses on understanding how technological advancements reshape the nature of work. It covers both the historical context of digitalization and the practical skills needed to thrive in today’s digital workplaces. This area emphasizes the tools and strategies necessary for organizing digital work, including the ability to select and adapt tools for specific situations. As work environments continue to evolve, driven by trends such as remote work, digital nomadism, and the rise of crowd-sourced platforms, students are introduced to state-of-the-art digital work practices. They also acquire technical skills, such as proficiency in Git, which are critical for managing distributed development and version control in collaborative settings. Beyond technical competencies, this area fosters the development of collaboration skills, with students participating in individual, team-based, and crowd-sourced projects to simulate real-world work scenarios. By engaging in these activities, students gain a deeper understanding of how digital tools enable flexible, personalized work environments while also exploring the ethical and societal implications of these shifts. The most prominent example of this focal area is the lecture Introduction to Digital Work, where these concepts are explored in-depth and applied through hands-on learning and practical projects.\nPrinciples of open-source development serve as a prime example of fully digital work and are central to this area of study.  These principles epitomize the collaborative, transparent, and community-driven nature of software development and work in the digital era. In the Open-Source Project, we teach students the fundamentals of distributed software development using Git, providing them with the tools necessary to manage and organize projects in a decentralized manner. Students engage in practical exercises focused on project organization, collaborative development, and maintaining code quality. These exercises ensure that students not only learn the technical aspects but also experience the real-world challenges and advantages of working in distributed development environments. Each student or group contributes to a public-facing Python package. Regular project updates, hacking sessions, and code reviews are integral to this area, providing iterative feedback and opportunities for continuous improvement. Through these hands-on experiences, students gain a comprehensive understanding of open-source development and the skills needed to work on collaborative, distributed software projects.\nThe knowledge synthesis area focuses on equipping students with the skills to synthesize academic and non-academic knowledge and conduct rigorous literature reviews. Central to this is the Literature Review Seminar, which covers the different types and goals of reviews, the review process, the qualities of review papers, and tools supporting the conduct of literature reviews. We encourage students to apply these review methods specifically to research on digital work, enabling them to explore and critically analyze current trends in digital transformation and its broader impact on workplaces. Through this process, students not only gain a deep understanding of knowledge synthesis but also develop the ability to identify and address key research gaps and contribute to the academic discourse.\nAcross the focal areas, we aim to foster a curiosity for academic and applied research, which is often reflected in students’ interest in pursuing thesis topics and engaging with our research projects.",

We try to avoid sending direct messages and documents as much as possible. Collaborating in these repositories has many benefits: repositories provide context (clearly identifying the project, its history, ongoing work, and open issues), llow us to reduce direct messages (the cognitive effort to search for related documents and coordinate asynchronous work), and use scripts like Labot for automation.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n\n    subgraph task[\"III.

This can be done through one-on-one discussions, self-assessment forms, or performance evaluations. Encourage team members to express their interests and areas where they want to develop their expertise.\nCreate a Training Plan: Based on the identified needs, develop a training plan that outlines the specific training programs or activities for each team member. Consider a mix of internal and external training options such as workshops, conferences, online courses, mentoring, and on-the-job training.\nEncourage Self-Learning: In addition to formal training programs, promote a culture of self-learning within the team. Encourage team members to explore relevant resources like online tutorials, books, research papers, and industry blogs. Provide access to online learning platforms or subscription services that offer a wide range of educational content.\nInternal Knowledge Sharing: Organize regular knowledge-sharing sessions where team members can present and discuss their ongoing projects, research findings, or new tools and techniques they have learned. Encourage collaboration and peer learning within the team.\nExternal Networking: Encourage team members to attend conferences, workshops, and seminars relevant to their research interests. Networking with experts in the field and participating in discussions and panels can provide valuable learning and collaboration opportunities.\n\n\nJob shadowing\n\nIf you need further support, arranging a job shadowing day can be helpful.\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nFeedback and Support: We regularly check in with team members to assess their progress and provide support.
