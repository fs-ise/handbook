## Formatting

- Use alignment (e.g., `ctrl`+`d`+`h`+`l` for left alignment)
- Adapt the size of the slide to the figure (`ctrl`+`h`+`ö`)

## Elements

- Consider the use of [free-form shapes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/draw-or-edit-a-freeform-shape-44d7bb9d-c05c-4e1c-a486-e35fc322299b){target=_blank} and editing individual points.

## Export when embedding figures in papers

- To have text embedded (searchable), use PDF exports (when figures are included in Markdown/Latex) or EMF (when figures are included in Word)
