## 2026-01-28
New releases:
- **search-query** v0.13.0 (https://pypi.org/project/search-query/)

  Release notes:

  > - **Versioned platform architecture & upgrades**: Introduced version-aware parser registry that selects list or string parsers per platform version and defaults to the latest registered release. Auto-discovery for parser, serializer, and translator implementations. Added an upgrade pipeline that routes through the generic query as an intermediate representation, exposed through a new `upgrade` CLI subcommand.
  > - **CLI improvements**: Rebuilt the CLI around explicit `translate`, `lint`, and `upgrade` sub-commands with improved error handling and user feedback, including success messages emitted by the linter workflow.
  > - **Search file handling**: Refactored `SearchFile` to replace `filepath` with `search_results_path`, derive the default history path, ensure directories exist when saving, and exclude private attributes from serialization output.
  > - **Linter updates**: Added the `deprecated-syntax` warning (`LINT_2001`) to guide users toward upgrading queries that rely on legacy syntax.
  > - **Documentation**: Documented the syntax upgrade workflow and versioning policy for database-specific queries, including CLI examples.
