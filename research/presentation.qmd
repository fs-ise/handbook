## General guidelines

- Adapt to the audience
- Prepare a short elevator pitch
- Plan for eventualities (e.g., no Internet/WIFI connection available)
- Make slides available [TODO : link repo] and allow participants to connect/give feedback (TODO : add suggestions)
- Communicate a clear reason why your audience should be interested in your presentation (in particular when some participants are required to attend)
- When appropriate: start with a bold pitch like "After this talk, you will do ... differently."
- When appropriate, use storytelling to make the presentation memorable
