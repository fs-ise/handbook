We develop software packages, primarily for literature reviews.
Our software is available in the [CoLRev Environment](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment){target=_blank} and the [fs-ise](https://github.com/orgs/fs-ise/repositories){target=_blank} organization.

[CoLRev](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev){target=_blank} is an open-source environment for collaborative literature reviews.
It integrates with different synthesis tools, takes care of the data, and facilitates Git-based collaboration. 
To accomplish these goals, CoLRev advances the design of review technology at the intersection of methods, design, cognition, and community building.
The following features stand out:

- Supports all literature review steps: problem formulation, search, dedupe, (pre)screen, pdf retrieval and preparation, and synthesis
- An open and extensible environment based on shared data and process standards
- Builds on git and its transparent collaboration model for the entire literature review process
- Offers a self-explanatory, fault-tolerant, and configurable user workflow
- Operates a model for data quality, content curation, and reuse
- Enables typological and methodological pluralism throughout the process

**search-query** is a Python package for parsing, validating, simplifying, and serializing search queries for academic databases. It currently supports PubMed, EBSCOHost, and Web of Science, using a standardized JSON schema (Haddaway et al., 2022).

- Programmatic use, CLI interface, and optional integration via pre-commit hooks
- Zero dependencies: easily embeddable across environments
- Extensible parser/validator architecture
- Tested on real-world queries from [searchRxiv](https://www.searchrxiv.org/){target=_blank}

[BibDedupe](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/bib-dedupe){target=_blank} is an open-source **Python library for deduplication of bibliographic records**, tailored for literature reviews.
Unlike traditional deduplication methods, BibDedupe focuses on entity resolution, linking duplicate records instead of simply deleting them.

- **Automated Duplicate Linking with Zero False Positives**: BibDedupe automates the duplicate linking process with a focus on eliminating false positives.
- **Preprocessing Approach**: BibDedupe uses a preprocessing approach that reflects the unique error generation process in academic databases, such as author re-formatting, journal abbreviation or translations.
- **Entity Resolution**: BibDedupe does not simply delete duplicates, but it links duplicates to resolve the entity and integrates the data. This allows for validation, and undo operations.
- **Programmatic Access**: BibDedupe is designed for seamless integration into existing research workflows, providing programmatic access for easy incorporation into scripts and applications.
- **Transparent and Reproducible Rules**: BibDedupe's blocking and matching rules are transparent and easily reproducible to promote reproducibility in deduplication processes.
- **Continuous Benchmarking**: Continuous integration tests running on GitHub Actions ensure ongoing benchmarking, maintaining the library's reliability and performance across datasets.
- **Efficient and Parallel Computation**: BibDedupe implements computations efficiently and in parallel, using appropriate data structures and functions for optimal performance.
