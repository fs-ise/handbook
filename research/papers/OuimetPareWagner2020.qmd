# Summary

::: { .justify }

Accessibility, continuity, and cost of care services present persistent challenges in today’s healthcare systems. Teleconsultation is considered an opportunity to address these challenges while maintaining quality of care. In this paper, we develop and empirically test an extended Expectation Confirmation Model via an online survey of Canadian users. Our findings reveal that the main determinants of continuance intention are user satisfaction, perceived usefulness, service quality, confirmation of expectations, and perceived ease of use. As user satisfaction, the main predictor, largely depends on initial expectations confirmation, managers should provide their employees with proper information about the possibilities, limitations and potential benefits of teleconsultation platforms and services. This study underscores the importance of taking context into account at the theorizing stage.
