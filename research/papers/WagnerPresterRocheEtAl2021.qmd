# Summary

Review papers are essential for knowledge development in Information Systems. While some are cited twice a day, others accumulate single digit citations over a decade. The magnitude of these differences prompts us to analyze what distinguishes those reviews that have proven to be integral to scientific progress from those that might be considered less impactful. Our results highlight differences between reviews aimed at describing, understanding, explaining, and theory testing. Beyond the control variables, they demonstrate the importance of methodological transparency and the development of research agendas. These insights inform all stakeholders involved in the development and publication of review papers.
