# Summary

Developing and framing an impactful review article at a top journal can be a daunting challenge, especially for graduate students and junior academics. With rising demands related to review types, methods, and contributions, guidance is sorely needed. In this short commentary, we draw on our experience as authors, reviewers, and editors of reviews, as well as instructors of a doctoral seminar on literature reviews. Our goal is to offer key recommendations on the elements of an impactful review paper and on the crucial role that feedback can play in the process. We believe these suggestions, together with the contributions of the special issue, are a useful resource for prospective authors of influential review papers.
