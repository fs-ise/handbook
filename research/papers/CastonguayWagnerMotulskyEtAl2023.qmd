# Summary

Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in health care are on the agenda of policymakers around the world, but a major challenge remains, namely, to set policies that will ensure wide acceptance and capture the value of AI while mitigating associated risks. Objective This study aims to provide an overview of how OECD countries strategize about how to integrate AI into health care and to determine their actual level of AI maturity. Methods A scan of government-based AI strategies and initiatives adopted in 10 proactive OECD countries was conducted. Available documentation was analyzed, using the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development's roadmap to AI maturity as a conceptual framework. Results The findings reveal that most selected OECD countries are at the Emerging stage (Level 2) of AI in health maturity. Despite considerable funding and a variety of approaches to the development of an AI in health supporting ecosystem, only the United Kingdom and United States have reached the highest level of maturity, an integrated and collaborative AI in health ecosystem (Level 3). Conclusion Despite policymakers looking for opportunities to expedite efforts related to AI, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ensure the sustainable development and safe use of AI in health. The principles of equifinality and mindfulness must thus guide policymaking in the development of AI in health care.
