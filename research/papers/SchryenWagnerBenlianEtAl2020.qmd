# Summary

Literature reviews (LRs) play an important role in developing domain knowledge in all fields. Yet, we observe insufficient insights into the activities with which LRs actually develop knowledge. To address this important gap, we 1) derive knowledge-building activities from the extant literature on LRs, 2) suggest a knowledge-based LR typology that complements existing typologies, and 3) apply the typology in an empirical study that explores how LRs with different goals and methodologies have contributed to knowledge development. In analyzing 240 LRs published in 40 renowned information systems (IS) journals between 2000 and 2014, we draw a detailed picture of knowledge development that one of the most important genres in the IS field has achieved. With this work, we help to unify extant LR conceptualizations by clarifying and illustrating how they apply different methodologies in a range of knowledge-building activities to achieve their goals with respect to theory.
