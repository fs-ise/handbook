# Summary

::: { .justify }

Digital platforms for knowledge work, such as Upwork, Freelancer.com and Amazon Mechanical Turk connect clients with millions of workers for a range of tasks, including software development, virtual assistance, and micro-tasks. Information systems research on this emergent phenomenon has gained traction in recent years regarding publication volume and research diversity. To identify relevant papers, to distinguish them from related types of digital platforms, and to guide future research, we conducted a scoping review, focusing on the information systems literature. Results are structured according to a theoretical framework of the knowledge work process, covering three phases: Worker-client matching, committing for future action, and executing commitments. While the first phase has been analyzed extensively, we contend that the main phases of the knowledge work process have received scant attention. In this emergent stage of extant research, our review identifies promising research directions to guide prospective studies.
