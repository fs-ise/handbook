## Journals and conferences

We collect PDFs from key IS journals and conferences. This is essential for full-text searching (see [tools](/research/systems.html)) and retrieval (e.g., using CoLRev).
PDFs are available [on Nextcloud]({{< var nextcloud.pdf_collection >}}){target=_blank}.

## Process

::: {.callout-note}
Note: only download conference proceedings/issues when they are complete.

TODO:

- explain how the overview is generated/upated
- Check: updating a PDF (to change the last-updated time stamp and document "last checked")
