## Principles

- Use [Markdown](../../10-lab/10_processes/10.07.markdown.html) for manuscripts, presentations, and knowledge management
- Use Git to version, collaborate, and share

The principles are reflected in the [paper template](20.20.paper-templates.html), the [presentation template](20.28.presentation.html), and the [thesis template](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/thesis-template){target=_blank}.

## Ethics

Research is conducted in line with the [Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice](https://zenodo.org/records/6472827){target=_blank} as well as the [AIS Code of Research Conduct](https://aisnet.org/page/AdmBullCResearchCond){target=_blank}.
